   - 背景: When product failed, team didn't work, things go wrong
   - 评估: Mindset, how they talk about it, how they relate to evaluating situation
   - "It really tells you a lot about how people think and how they perceive themselves when things are not working well"

4. **"Tell me something you did that worked out, but not for the reason that you thought it would"** OR **"Tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work"** (Ayo Omojola, CPO at Carbon Health)
   - 目的: "Teasing out introspection"
   - 评估: "Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you've made, and why they worked and why they did not, and incorporating that into your model so you make different decisions next time?"

5. **"Something people have learned about themselves that reveal the limitation in how they work"** (Scott Belsky, Chief Strategy Officer at Adobe)
   - 测试: Introspection能力
   - 观察: Once they hit limits/struggles

#### **思维与问题解决类 (Thinking & Problem Solving)**

7. **"A group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you to be their business counterpart. What do you do?"** (Shishir Mehrotra, CEO/Co-founder of Coda)
   - **Eigenquestion test**: "A very simple question, and it's a coded Eigenquestion test"
   - Process: 先让他们问问题,然后说"scientists hate talking to people, they'll only answer two questions"
   - Good answer示例:
     - "Is it safe enough for humans or not?" (crisp way to get to safety/reliability)
     - "Is it more expensive CapEx or OpEx?" (buy vs run cost)
   - 然后用这两个问题形成quadrants来决定商业模式
   - **Insight**: "I find that people's ability to learn the method is significantly higher if it's low stakes"
   - Kids are incredibly good at this - "It's actually a skill we remove from ourselves"
   - **应用**: "There are Eigenquestions everywhere. You could take any product out there"

8. **"What unfair secrets have you learned to improve the velocity and energy level of a product team?"** (Noah Weiss, CPO at Slack)
   - "Unfair" or "secret" = not something read on media
   - 内容: What did you learn? How did you learn it? How does it work? How do you apply it?
   - 结果: "You also just get amazing, interesting bits of inspiration from asking that"

9. **"What's something that everyone takes for granted that you think is essentially hogwash or inaccurate?"** (Nikhyl Singhal, VP of Product at Facebook)
   - Variation for managers: "What's conventional wisdom that you bet against, that you have found is actually inaccurate?"
   - 目的: "I'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset"
   - 问题: "Everyone always prepares for interviews, and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say"
   - 价值: "There's no way to answer that question without being genuinely opinionated"
   - This is the **save question** when dismissing high-quality people who weren't genuine

#### **动机与价值观类 (Motivation & Values)**

10. **"Tell me what work you are most proud of?"** (Katie Dill, Head of Design at Stripe; Karri Saarinen, CEO of Linear; Camille Hearst, Product Leader at Spotify/former Patreon)
    - **Three leaders, same favorite question**
    - Katie Dill: Helps understand their **taste and judgment**, what motivates them, what work they view as good, where their gravity pulls them
    - Karri Saarinen: "Gives you a little bit of indication of what the person values and how they think about things"
    - Camille Hearst: Learn about motivations, work ethic, what they care about, what good looks like to them
    - Bonus: "People can share something they think they did really well" vs negative questions

11. **"Tell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful."** (Lauryn Isford, Head of Growth at Notion, former Airtable)
    - 评估: How they define impact and what it means to them
    - Growth practitioner的good answer: **Intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business**

12. **"Describe to me a time when you were part of a controversial product decision. What did you do?"** (Yuhki Yamashita, Chief Product Officer at Figma)
    - 评估能力: Can they set up conflict, understand why problem was important, represent both sides?
    - 信号: "Can they take on these different perspectives in an even-keeled way?"
    - Storytelling: "A really great product manager casts something - this is why it's so existential and interesting"
    - "At the end of the day, so much of our job is around storytelling and communication"

#### **行为与情境类 (Behavioral & Situational)**

13. **Behavioral questions around challenging/ambiguous situations** (Jiaona Zhang, Head of Product at Webflow, former Airbnb)
    - Focus: "When they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate?"
    - **Ambiguity is key**: "The PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter"
    - Good answers: **People who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity**
    - Want: PMs who don't say "Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity" but **put a path forward**
    - Also look for: **Seeking help/inputs** vs "Yep, this is very clear"
    - Milestones: "What are the little milestones that make you say - hey, is this working? Is this not working?"

14. **"What would your siblings say about you?"** (Meltem Kuran Berkowitz, Head of Growth at Deel, early employee)
    - If no siblings: "What will your parents say about you?"
    - 评估: Sincerity and self-awareness
    - Insight: "Your siblings are never... I mean, I love my sister, but she'll call me and talk to me a lot"
    - Bad answer: "They'll say I'm organized and bring family together" = probably bullshit
    - Good answer: "They'll say these weird things about me" = shows self-awareness and humbleness

#### **成长与未来导向类 (Growth & Future Orientation)**

15. **"Fast forward three years, what's different about you then?"** (Ben Williams, former VP of Product at Snyk, now advisor)
    - Many default to role/title aspirations
    - **Looking for**: Signals of humility, self-awareness around personal and professional growth
    - Love: "People who can be open about where they think they need to work on to grow themselves as people"

16. **"What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?"** (Paul Adams, CPO at Intercom, for reference calls)
    - **For reference calls** after you want to give them the job
    - Why amazing: "The person can't dodge it. There's an answer, and it's incredibly enlightening"
    - Referees are favorite people, but this question gets real feedback

#### **其他观察到的特质**

17. **Curiosity** (Ben Williams)
    - Not a specific question, but something he looks for
    - "Day-to-day, good PMs will be asking 'why' as much as my six-year-old son does"
    - Try to discern through conversation

18. **DEIB involvement** (Candidate asked Ben Williams this)
    - Brilliant question from candidate: **"Tell me about the diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging initiatives that you've recently personally been involved with?"**
    - Purpose: Test alignment of personal values with someone they'd work closely with

## 3. 心法与原则

### 面试哲学的共识

#### **打破面试模式**
- **Nikhyl Singhal**: "I'm always looking for people to break this sort of interview mindset"
- Problem: "Everyone always prepares for interviews, and then their entire conversation is predicting what you think you want me to say"
- Risk: "You can have high-quality people that you dismiss, because they weren't genuine"
- Solution: Questions that **cannot be answered without being genuinely opinionated**

#### **低压力环境测试真实能力**
- **Shishir Mehrotra**: Teleportation device question
- Insight: "I find that people's ability to learn the method is significantly higher if it's low stakes"
- Kids vs adults: "Kids are incredibly good at simplifying these things down. It's actually a skill we remove from ourselves"
- 应用: "You could take any product out there. What is the Eigenquestion that really drives this answer?"

#### **关注本质而非表象**
- **Yuhki Yamashita**: 争议性产品决策问题
- 测试: 能否理解冲突存在的原因,能否represent multiple sides
- 信号: "Can they take on these different perspectives?"
- Storytelling能力: "A really great product manager casts something - this is why it's so existential and interesting"

### 自我认知的重要性

#### **成功归因**
- **Eeke De Miliano**: Humble people always say "luck"
- 强制排除luck,迫使真实反思
- "How self-aware are you basically, and how curious are you?"

#### **理解自身局限**
- **Scott Belsky**: Learning about limitations
- 测试introspection和blame vs ownership
- "Can they be open and introspective, or are they going to blame and point fingers?"

#### **反思性决策**
- **Ayo Omojola**: Outcomes vs reasoning
- "Tell me something that worked but not for the reason you thought"
- "Tell me something that was a good decision that didn't work"
- 核心: "Are you reflective about why decisions worked/didn't, and incorporating that into your model?"

## 4. 实战手册

### Eigenquestion方法 (Shishir Mehrotra)

**Step 1: 让candidate自由提问**
- "Tell me more about this device. What does it do? How does it work? Is it big? Small? Vast? Does it disintegrate things? Need receiver and sender? Is it safe?"
- 让所有questions come out

**Step 2: 限制为两个问题**
- "Scientists hate talking to people, they're annoyed by your questions. They'll only answer two questions, then expect a plan."
- "What two questions do you ask?"

**Step 3: 评估问题质量**
- Good questions:
  - "Is it safe enough for humans or not?" (crisp)
  - "Is it more expensive CapEx or OpEx?"
- Bad questions: "What size is it?" → "What decision is that going to allow you to make?"

**Step 4: 观察如何用这两个questions形成框架**
- Safe + CapEx high = Human fax machines everywhere
- Safe + OpEx high = Replace airports (strategic placement)
- Not safe = High-value goods transport

**应用到任何产品**:
- "You can take any product out there"
- Example: Daughter asked "How come three gas stations on same corner?"
- Eigenquestion: "How do you place a gas station?"

### Ambiguity处理评估 (Jiaona Zhang)

**Good Answer特征**:
1. **Put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity**
   - Not "Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity"
   - But "Here's a path forward"

2. **Seeking help and inputs**
   - Not "Yep, this is the way. This is very clear."
   - But "Let me get those inputs, understand why I put this path together"

3. **Milestone checking**
   - "What are the little milestones that make you say - hey, is this working?"
   - Willingness to make different decisions based on learning

**为什么重要**:
- "The PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter"

### Self-Awareness测试技巧

**For success attribution**:
- Explicitly say "You can't say 'luck'"
- Forces genuine reflection
- Reveals thinking patterns

**For limitations**:
- "What have you learned about yourself that reveal limitations?"
- Watch reaction when they hit struggles: Open/introspective vs blame/point fingers

**For siblings' perspective**:
- "What would your siblings say about you?"
- Good: "They'll say these weird things about me" (self-awareness)
- Bad: "They'll say I'm organized" (probably bullshit, lack of self-awareness)

### Reference Call黄金问题 (Paul Adams)

**The Question**: "What feedback will I be giving this person in their first performance review?"

**Why it works**:
- Referees are favorite people/managers
- They expect to praise candidate
- This question **cannot be dodged**
- "There's an answer, and it's incredibly enlightening"

**Usage**:
- After interview, you want to give them the job
- They have referees (best people/favorite managers)
- Ask this question to get real feedback

### 打破面试准备模式

**Problem**: Candidates prepare standard answers, predicting what you want to hear
**Solution**: Questions requiring genuine opinion

**Nikhyl Singhal's approach**:
- "What's something everyone takes for granted that you think is hogwash?"
- "There's no way to answer that without being genuinely opinionated"
- This is the **save question** for high-quality people who weren't genuine

**Variations**:
- For managers: "What conventional wisdom do you bet against?"
- For domains: "What do people think about X that's inaccurate?"

### Storytelling和Communication评估

**Yuhki Yamashita的争议性决策问题**:
- Can they set up conflict understanding?
- Can they represent both sides?
- Can they do it in even-keeled way taking different perspectives?
- **Storytelling**: "A really great product manager casts something - this is why it's so existential and this is why it's so interesting"
- "At the end of the day, so much of our job is around storytelling and communication"

**Alternative**: "Talk about a big problem you worked on"
- Test: "Coming out of that, do I feel compelled to work on that problem?"
- "No matter how boring it sounds on the surface, a really great product manager casts something"

### 增长思维评估

**Lauryn Isford's Impact Question**:
- "Tell me about a time you delivered something impactful"
- 观察: How they define impact
- Good answer for growth: **Intrinsic motivation about having impact on the business**
- Not just external recognition or promotion

## 5. 反常识视角

### Kids are better at Eigenquestions than adults
- Shishir Mehrotra: "Almost every kid will quickly get to two pretty good Eigenquestions"
- "It's actually a skill we remove from ourselves"
- Adults lose the ability to simplify to core questions
- **Application**: This is a learnable skill, not innate talent

### Sibling perspective reveals more than self-assessment
- Meltem Kuran Berkowitz: "Your siblings are never... I love my sister, but she'll call me"
- Siblings won't give the polished, PR-ready answer
- They reveal the real you, including weird things
- **Counterintuitive**: Family members give more honest assessment than strangers

### "Unfair secrets" are more inspiring than standard advice
- Noah Weiss: "What unfair secrets have you learned to improve velocity?"
- Not something from media articles
- Real, hard-won insights from experience
- "You get amazing, interesting bits of inspiration"

### Luck admission reveals confidence
- Scott Belsky: "Do you consider yourself lucky?"
- Insecure people decline admitting luck
- Confident people comfortable admitting privilege/luck
- "The truth is, we're all very lucky and certainly privileged"

### Ambiguity tolerance > Perfect answers
- Jiaona Zhang: Focus on how they navigate ambiguity
- PM job = ambiguous by definition
- Good PMs put structure through ambiguity, not freeze
- Seeking help is strength, not weakness
- **Counterintuitive**: Not knowing is expected; how you proceed is what matters

### Genuine opinion > Prepared answers
- Nikhyl Singhal: Uses "hogwash" question to break interview mindset
- High-quality people dismissed for being not genuine
- This question **saves** those candidates
- "I don't want the interview process to penalize them"
