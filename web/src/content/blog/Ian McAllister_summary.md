# Ian McAllister - 播客摘要

## 嘉宾简介
Ian McAllister - Uber全球产品高级总监,负责车辆平台;前Amazon产品领袖(12年)、Airbnb产品领导者;著名文章《What Separates a Top 1% PM from a Top 10% PM》作者

## 1. 核心议题
- **顶级PM的核心能力**: 新手PM应重点培养哪些技能vs资深PM需要突破什么
- **Amazon Working Backwards流程**: 如何真正实施working backwards,常见错误及正确方法
- **产品领导力发展**: 从PM到CPO的成长路径和关键转折点
- **信任作为货币**: 为什么trust是产品领导者的核心竞争力

## 2. 核心洞察

### 新手PM的三大核心能力
- **沟通 (Communicate)**: 不是天生的,需要持续练习和刻意改进
  - 答案优先原则: "When is this shipping?" → "October 15th" (先给日期再解释)
  - 用数字回答问题,避免weasel words(模糊词汇)
  - 每次沟通后给自己打分,思考如何改进
  - "Book of Kim"原则: 避免weasel words、答案优先、own your problems

- **优先级 (Prioritize)**: **产品管理的第一核心工具**
  - 维度: 哪些主题?哪些项目?如何排序?每个项目做多少?
  - 时间管理也是优先级功能: 把all in的项目做好,其他starve
  - "Given the same skill and resources, PM with great prioritization generates **5X impact**"
  - Amazon的working backwards from fitness function/metric是关键技巧

- **执行 (Execute)**: 不仅仅是shipping,而是molding into simple compact package with highest impact
  - 执行效果依赖团队质量(设计、数据科学、工程师)
  - PM是execution的engine: "If you stall out, the project stalls out"
  - 帮助团队提升sprint效率是ownership的一部分

### 资深PM的三大突破点
- **Think Big**: "At our scale we got to hunt for bigger elephants" (Warren Buffett)
  - 开始时问: "Could this be bigger? More impactful?"
  - 扩展视野: 不仅仅是product/tech,而是任何影响成功的东西
  - "You own it until you find somebody else to own it"

- **Earn Trust**: **"Trust is the currency of a product leader"**
  - 重复设定并满足期望: "That's a good mantra to think about"
  - 实践: tell the truth without fail, launch when you say, own mistakes
  - 破坏信任: lie, be evasive, don't ship what you said, ignore mistakes
  - Airbnb教训: 在customer support技术平台项目中,没有足够与support leadership团队建立真正support和relationships,导致执行不顺利

- **Driven by Impact**: "If you forget about everything else... wake up every day trying to have the biggest impact you can"
  - 不要关注promotion/politics/org size
  - 前10年在Amazon: "I was just hungry to have an impact. Take my business, grow it as fast as possible"
  - 结果是多次promotion,但那不是驱动力
  - "The flywheel of product leadership: have impact → get tasked with bigger challenges → have more impact"

### 反常识视角
- **Working Backwards的本质错误**: 大多数团队说在working backwards,但实际上不是
  - 错误做法: "We have these technologies, let's combine them" (从solution出发)
  - 正确做法: 从customer problem开始,obsess about the problem
  - 识别信号: 如果谈论"we could combine X and Y" → 没有真正working backwards
  - Amazon失败案例: ASIN to ASIN linking项目 - 已经是Jeff项目,但不是working backwards,最终shutdown

- **Press Release不是核心**: 只是强制working backwards thinking的mechanism
  - 核心是: "You don't think what we could build, you think about the problem and then the solution"
  - Press release structure: problem paragraph → solution → customer quote → FAQs
  - 最终如果培养了working backwards muscle,可以用任何格式

### 具体比喻和框架
- **"Box of product management"**: 大多数PM在box内操作(roadmap, features, work with eng);顶级PM扩展到整个disciplines
- **"Hunt for bigger elephants"**: Think Big的比喻 - 在任何scale都要寻找更大影响力
- **"Human in the loop"**: AI工具中human的角色, Copilot is copilot not pilot
- **"Fitness function"**: Amazon的做法 - 找到one metric determining success,然后让那个数字go up and to the right

## 3. 心法与原则

### Amazon的Leadership Learnings
**Jeff Bezos的特质**:
- Super encouraging: "This process doesn't have to be efficient because the prerequisite for efficiency is knowing where you're going"
- 教学moment: "If you don't have a problem paragraph, there's not really a problem" (Ian跳过problem paragraph)
- 提供working backwards training

**Jeff Wilke的特质**:
- **Consummate operator**: 建立了Amazon的operational muscle
- Weekly Business Review (WBR): 1小时review整个北美retail业务的metrics
- **Tough love**: "Your dad might look over his glasses at you" - 专业但有时需要kick in the ass
- **Teacher**: 不只是说这是right thing,而是teach the why and the mental model
  - "Just taking 10 seconds in a meeting to teach"
  - 比prescriptive advice更有lasting effect

### Working Backwards的Three Tests
1. **Is it a big idea?**
2. **Is it something we should be doing?** (e.g., oil from shale - big but not for Amazon)
3. **Is there a legitimate plan to succeed?**

FAQs = early stage legitimate test of whether this has a plan

### Career Philosophy
- **写作的力量**: 从整理自己的thoughts开始,最终影响整个career trajectory
  - Quora上的working backwards文章和1% PM文章
  - 价值: making connections with people in the industry
  - "Business writing: you've got to be a clear thinker to be a clear communicator"
  - 写作的two tests: thinking + communication

## 4. 实战手册

### Communicate改进的Tactical Tips
1. **Operator's Manual**: Ian收集的best practices
   - Avoid weasel words
   - Answer first and then explain
   - Own your problems
   - Use numbers to answer questions

2. **持续改进流程**:
   - Meeting/email后给自己打分
   - 问manager: "What could I have done better?"
   - Grade yourself after you communicate

3. **Answer-first examples**:
   - Q: "When is this shipping?"
   - A: "October 15th. Here's why..." (not "Well this thing is taking longer...")

### Prioritization的Amazon方法
1. **Working Backwards Process**:
   - Start with customer problem (not solution!)
   - Write internal press release (problem paragraph required!)
   - Write FAQs (legitimate plan to succeed)
   - Review with leadership

2. **Fitness Function Approach**:
   - Find one metric that determines success
   - Make that metric go up and to the right
   - Example: Amazon Smile - direct traffic loyalty (not Prime paid program)

3. **Prioritization dimensions**:
   - Which themes in roadmap?
   - Which projects within theme?
   - How to sequence projects?
   - How much of each project to build?
   - Time management (what to starve vs what to all-in)

### Earn Trust的具体实践
**Building Trust**:
- Repeatedly setting and meeting expectations
- Calling your shots: forecast, set goal, hit it
- Tell the truth without fail
- Launch when you say you'd launch, launch what you said
- Own your mistakes (don't ignore or repeat)

**Breaking Trust**:
- Lie or be evasive
- Don't ship what you said
- Ignore your mistakes or repeat them

**Airbnb Learning**:
- Mistake: 没有足够partner with customer support leadership team
- Result: Right product and strategy, but didn't land because lack of support
- Lesson: "If you don't build the support and relationships, the right product may not get executed as well"

### Working Backwards实施指南
**Template Structure**:
1. **Problem paragraph**: What's the customer pain?
2. **Solution paragraph**: How do we solve it?
3. **Customer quote**: In customer's voice
4. **FAQs**: Legitimate plan to succeed (internal components, finances, technical hurdles)

**Common Mistakes**:
- Starting from solution/technology ("we have X and Y, let's combine")
- Skipping problem paragraph (means no real problem!)
- Retrofitting problem to solution (adding problem after solution decided)

**Implementation tips**:
- Not every feature needs full process (there's scale below which it doesn't make sense)
- For new products: absolutely use it
- Spirit > template: if you have the muscle, can use any format
- Review as gate for approval (like with Bezos for Amazon Smile)

### 新手vs资深PM Focus
**Year 1 PM**: Focus on
- Communicate
- Prioritize
- Execute

**Senior PM**: Focus on
- Think Big
- Earn Trust
- Driven by Impact

## 5. 反常识视角 (Expanded)

### "You're not the protagonist"
- 在工作的故事中,你不是主角
- Instead of convincing CEO, **understand CEO's vision and operationalize it**
- This advice "transformed how I see the world and my own happiness"
- Makes work better for everybody: shared mental model vs everyone fighting

### Success comes from hunger for impact
- "I wasn't thinking about promotion. I was just focused on taking my book of business and making it bigger"
- Result: promoted multiple times
- "The right way the world should work: person with massive impact should grow"
- Don't optimize for politics or bigger org

### Writing changes careers
- Started as fun on Quora, just to structure thoughts
- Result: connections with industry people, eventually joined Airbnb
- "Clear thinking = Clear communication" (two tests)
- "Sharpening your ax" through business writing

### Failure stories are valuable
- Airbnb lesson is still referenced years later
- Continuous improvement mindset: "What could I have done better?"
- Self-awareness about what went wrong builds muscle
