## 2. 核心洞察 (Core Conclusions)

### 关于创业失败
- **"如果深入分析公司失败的原因，非常简单——他们不和用户交流"**
- **这意味着他们找不到产品市场契合度（PMF）**
- **"如果你找不到PMF，其他都不重要"**
- **YC Slack的headline**: "Make things people want"（做人们想要的东西）
- **"这仍然是true，永远都是true"**

### 关于创始人动机
- **动机多样性**: 成功创始人的motivations can be very diverse
- **不是绝望**: "Desperation听起来像一个negative starting place"
- **大多数从positive place开始**: "I actually think that most people start companies from a positive place"
- **错误的动机**: "如果你认为创业是一个career step，那是一个不好的理由"
  - "如果成功，它将是你整个职业生涯（很可能10年）"
  - "如果不成功，那不是人们generally aspire to start的事情"

### 关于YC Office Hours
- **Regular Office Hours（一对一）**:
  - 每周或隔周一次
  - 问题: **"What's holding you back?"（什么在阻碍你？）**
  -贯穿整个项目，甚至在项目结束后几年继续

- **Group Office Hours（7-8家startup）**:
  - 创始人围坐成一圈（ring）
  - **必须把laptops和phones放在地上**
  - **只用pen and paper**
  - 问题: **"What are your goals for next two weeks and what were your goals for the last two weeks and did you hit the goals?"**
  - **"If you didn't hit them, what came in the way of hitting the goals?"**

- **效果**: "Just by talking about the things that held you back or the things that allowed you to hit your goals, uncover something material for the other seven companies"

## 3. 心法与原则

### 核心哲学
- **"Make things people want"** - YC的永恒真理
- **与用户交流是一切**: "It's all about talking to customers and learning that you're building something that's actually useful"

### 关于Airbnb团队
- **10年后反思**: "我问了每个人，'你找到更好的了吗？'"
- **除了maybe一两个人，没听说任何人说找到了更好的**
- **"他们都非常怀念那段时光"**
- **"Airbnb doesn't feel like a normal job"**

### 关于早期招聘
- **不是所有事情都有效**: "I would like to say that all the things we did were the cause of the outcome, but that's not really how the world works"
- **一些事情有效，一些无效**: "Some of the things we did work, some of the things we did did not work"
- **很难disentangle**: "It's hard for us to actually disentangle what those things are"
