# Hilary Gridley - 播客摘要

## 嘉宾简介
Hilary Gridley - WHOOP核心产品负责人(Head of Core Product);前Big Health高级产品总监、Dropbox高级产品营销经理;著名文章《How to Become a Super Manager with AI》作者(Newsletter第6受欢迎文章)

## 1. 核心议题
- **帮助团队学会"承受打击"(Take a Punch)**: 在困难时期和挫折中如何thriving而非surviving
- **透明度与思维模型共享**: 让团队理解领导层的思考方式,提升组织效率
- **习惯培养的艺术**: 用行为心理学原理改变团队行为,而非仅仅教育
- **个人幸福感与工作表现的关系**: 创造空间让团队成员做自己

## 2. 核心洞察

### "Take a Punch"的核心技巧

**场景定义**: 当某事出错、你说错话、听到别人批评你的工作时的生理感觉

**核心方法: Counter-Program the Narrative**
- **错误反应**: "That's not fair. I want to correct the record" (defensive, obsessed with what others think)
- **正确方法**: "What is one thing I can do to demonstrate the opposite of what I'm afraid this person thinks of me?"

**具体案例** (Ketamine tracking事件):
- Situation: Hilary在会议中笑CTO提出的ketamine tracking想法
- Reaction: CTO严肃回应"This isn't funny, this is a serious issue"
- Hilary的感受: Humiliated,担心被认为不重视成瘾问题
- **Counter-program行动**:
  - 花5-10分钟研究emerging public health concerns
  - 发现sports betting正在成为年轻人问题
  - 发送note: "Build on your idea. I found research on sports betting. We could track it and correlate with stress data."
  - 结果: 展示了她确实认真对待这些健康问题

**教学团队的方法**:
1. 当成员来找我agitated时
2. 问: "What's going on in your head? What are you afraid of?"
3. 常见回答: "They think I'm bad at my job / I'm an idiot"
4. **Challenge that thinking**: "First, is there evidence for that? Even if there is, it doesn't matter. What can you do to show them it's not true?"
5. **Give agency**: Focus on next action that demonstrates who you know yourself to be

**来源**: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy中的**Behavioral Activation**概念
- Depression misconception: "I'll feel better and then I'll act"
- Truth: "I will act and then I will feel better"
- Must identify actions that reverse negative spiral

### 透明度与思维模型共享

**问题**: "Why do 10 people have to sign off on this email?"
- 不是process problem
- 是transparency and communication problem
- 人们有不同的信息和context,对CEO和战略领导者的working model不同

**解决方案: Share How Leaders Think, Not Just What**
- 理解CEO think vs 理解CEO thinks
- 当团队理解你的thinking model,不需要你approve emails

**每周实践**:
- 在重要会议上,注意"note behind the note"
- 每周发Slack rundown给团队:
  - "Here are the most important conversations I had this week"
  - "Here's what that person said verbatim"
  - "Here's what I interpret that as. Here's why I think they're saying that"
  - "Here's what I'm going to do differently as a result"
- 不是long documents,而是quick rundowns

**CEO Will Ahmed的Mental Model示例**:
- 表面现象: "This doesn't feel like the future"
- 误解: "He wants maximal scope on everything"
- Hilary的理解: He's focused on building the health company of the future
- 应用: 不是blow up scope或throw AI at everything
- 真正含义: Find **high impact but low cost** ways to make product feel magical
- Example: 用用户的own data解释VO2 Max (用AI coach让conversational)
- "This knows so much about me and can sort signal from noise in elegant ways"

### Magic Questions技巧

**核心**: 不是open-ended questions,而是statements ending with "Do you agree?" or "Is that right?"

**工作原理**:
- Put facts in front of people
- See what they say no to and yes to
- If they're good communicators, they'll explain why
- If not, you don't need their explanation to calibrate

**应用场景**:
- 与legal/compliance teams合作(regulatory interpretation)
- 团队问"What do you think I should do?" → Rephrase as "Tell me what you think, then ask if I agree"
- **Benefits**:
  1. Forces them to make assertion (calibrate judgment over time)
  2. They don't become reliant on you for answers
  3. Fastest way to understand how another person thinks

**重要前提**: Go in pure of heart
- Goal is to understand, not to get to yes
- Come from curiosity and humility: "Help me understand how I'm wrong"
- Make sure you're caring yourself in non-hostile way

### "You're Not Special" - 最重要的建议

**来源**: 前Coinbase CPO (now founder of Bridge)
- **Big mistake**: Trying to get what's in your head and influence CEO
- **Your actual job**: Understand CEO's vision and what they care about → Figure out how to operationalize that in best possible manifestation as product

**文学类比**:
- You can be protagonist in your life, family story
- **But in the story of work at a company, you are probably not the protagonist**
- "You're not special" - transformed how I see the world and my happiness

**为什么重要**:
- 如果每个人从protagonist viewpoint操作 → extremely inefficient, extremely painful
- Shared mental model cannot be defined by your narrow perspective
- Makes work better for everybody

**不等于**: "Just do whatever the boss says"
- Still important to bring skills, talents, perspective, taste, craft
- But understanding how to build shared mental model that definitionally can't be defined by your perspective

**在哪里找到fulfillment**:
- If somebody else were in this job, it would be done differently
- Something about the product is different because I worked on it
- From my unique perspective, experiences, influences
- **Playing Jenga**: Find pieces that can move
  - Immovable forces = not battles worth fighting
  - Areas where they don't know as much or scared = opportunities to step in and be valuable

### 反常识视角

**Too many PMs playing on "easy mode"**:
- Hot take: "Why are you building products for people exactly like you at companies that sell to other companies that don't worry about pricing?"
- Wish: See more people with pure love of product management applying to building for low income people, social services
- Recognition: Some people doing this work, appreciate it, but wish to see more
- Reason: Level of prestige associated with certain companies, better pay, totally get it but...

**Fear prevents people from doing hard things**:
- People gravitate toward things they're likely to succeed at
- Need more people: "Screw it. I'm going to do something that's probably going to fail. It's important and worth doing and I'm going to do it well."
- Easy stuff is done. What's left is hard: hardware, deep tech, ML/AI
- Also AI changing so much creates stress and uncertainty

## 3. 心法与原则

### Leadership Philosophy

**"In the story of work, you are probably not the protagonist"**
- Most important advice for happiness and effectiveness
- Don't spend time/energy trying to convince people
- Focus on understanding and operationalizing vision

**Taking a punch = Learning to thrive through uncertainty**
- Relevant today because of AI fears, layoff threads, psychic toll
- Too many people fearful about future careers, gravitate to safe things
- Need more people taking on hard, challenging problems

**Behavioral Activation Applied to Work**
- Origin: CBT techniques for depression
- "I will act and then I will feel better" (not reverse)
- List of behavioral activations on phone
- As manager: Help team see how they're sabotaging themselves, help them counter-program

### Managing Disagreement with Leadership

**When you disagree with leader decision**:

Step 1: Go through "What if I'm wrong" exercise
- Don't expect straightforward answer (confidentiality, hunch informed by decades of judgment)
- Try to get to bottom of their POV

Step 2: If still disagree, be candid but respectful
- Avoid: "This sucks, I have no control, but it's my job"
- Separate: Your opinion vs "What is the insight that makes it make sense to them?"

Step 3: Explain their rationale
- "I don't necessarily think this is how I would do it, or I don't agree"
- "But from their point of view, professional experience, I could see how this makes sense"
- "They might be right. I don't think they're right, but they might be"
- "The only way we're going to find out is if we give it the best shot"

Step 4: Reorient around world where it's not terrible answer
- "In product, there's no right answers, only wrong answers"
- "We're just trying to execute well on the least wrong answer"
- "The only chance we have of succeeding is not being torn apart on this"

### Habit Formation Principles (来自Behavioral Psychology)

**Three Components**:
1. **Consistency**: How are you getting someone doing something every single day?
2. **Reduce Friction**: Has to start super easy, no more than 1-2 minutes
3. **Design Reward Loops**: Powerful, immediate, emotional

**Anti-pattern**: Education model (teach → assess → accountability)
**Better**: Behavioral psychology model

**Example: AI Adoption on Team**

**Wrong Approach**: "How do you measure it? How do you enforce it?"

**Hilary's Approach**:
- Focus on "How am I creating habits around using this?"
- **30 Days of GPT**: List of 30 things, one every day
- Not education tool, but habit formation tool
- Nobody goes through it without coming out 100x more confident and using it daily

**Key to AI Habit Formation**:
- Start with things **NOT related to work** (remove friction)
- Examples:
  - Coming up with times/places for vacation
  - Upload calendar, ask for talking points for meetings
  - Fun, simple use cases where there's no work pressure
- Why not work examples: "Work is hard. Last thing you want is more friction when deadline"

**Reward Loop Design**:
- Custom GPTs as learning tool:
  - You write the prompt
  - They upload document → get specific output
  - Joy of "This helps me, this was cool"
  - Without despair of "I'm not good at prompting"
- Shout-outs in team meetings when someone uses AI in new way
- Make them feel like a million bucks

**WHOOP's Reward Loop Examples**:

**1. Alcohol and Recovery Score**:
- Red recovery after drinking feels really bad emotionally
- Green recovery feels great: "I'm doing something well, taking care of myself, I'm healthy"
- Quote: "I've had problems with drinking for years. It wasn't until I got on WHOOP that I was able to get a handle on it."
- They had the info before, but seeing that red score has profound emotional impact

**2. Healthspan Feature**:
- Challenge: "When I make healthy changes today, I won't see results for decades"
- Short term reward loops often feel bad (change is hard, feels bad before good)
- Solution: **The Amoeba** - shows WHOOP age, colors, moves based on daily behaviors
- See breakdown: sleep, VO2 Max, sleep consistency, heart rate zones, strength training
- Powerful reward loop: seeing numbers/colors change makes people able to make changes and feel good

**Reward Loop for Team Self-Care**:
- Anti-pattern: Rewarding "They stayed up till 2am to get it done"
- Better: Reward when people take care of themselves outside work
- Example: Emily (teaches at Handlebar)
  - Before long meetings: "Emily, lead stretches to get energy up"
  - Shout-out: "Everyone come check out Emily at Handlebar this Saturday 10am"
  - Everyone laughing, smiling, in good mood → perfect time to make someone feel like a million bucks
  - Permission structure: "Am I allowed to have this other job outside work?"

### Creating Space for Creativity

**Modeling, Not Organizing Events**:
- Show people it's possible to carve out space
- Talk about your crafts (illustration, writing, reading)
- Make it visible and normalized

**Asking in 1:1s**:
- "What do you do for joy?"
- "Are you doing something every single day that brings you joy?"
- If no: "That's a problem. What are we going to do about it?"
- If they don't know: Behavioral activation them - "Try some things, get back to me on what worked"

**Why This Matters**:
- "Why are we here if it's just to toil and be miserable?"
- They will be better people at work and do better work
- Permission structure: Shows they can take back their life
- "So much of it is self-inflicted" - PMs "so busy, in meetings all day"
- At some point you have to be responsible for getting yourself out of the weeds

## 4. 实战手册

### Take a Punch Implementation Guide

**For Managers - Teaching Your Team**:

1. **When team member comes upset**:
   - Ask: "It seems like this is really bothering you. What's going on in your head?"
   - Ask: "What are you afraid of? What are you worried about?"

2. **Challenge the negative thinking**:
   - "First, I don't think there's evidence for that. Is there evidence?"
   - "Even if there is, it doesn't really matter."

3. **Focus on action**:
   - "What's something you could do to show them that it's not true?"
   - "You know it's not true. How can you demonstrate that?"

4. **Give agency**:
   - Help them feel secure in their identity through action
   - Get them out of negative spiral and trough of despair

**For Individuals - Self-Application**:

1. **Create behavioral activation list**:
   - Things that reliably lift your mood
   - Keep on phone for when walls are closing in

2. **When you feel punched**:
   - Identify what you're afraid they think of you
   - Ask: "What's one small thing I can do to demonstrate the opposite?"
   - Take that action (can be 5-10 minutes)

3. **Don't litigate the past**:
   - Don't try to correct the record
   - Don't obsess over what others think (you don't control it)
   - Move on, take action, move forward

### Mental Model Sharing Implementation

**Weekly Practice**:

1. **Attend important meetings**
   - Pay attention to "note behind the note"
   - Notice: Why are they saying this? What insight are they bringing?

2. **Send weekly Slack rundown** (not long):
   - Most important/interesting conversations
   - What they said verbatim
   - Your interpretation of why they said it
   - Where it's coming from
   - What you'll do differently as result

3. **In team meetings**:
   - Go through notes from week
   - Voiceover and editorialize as you go
   - Connect the dots for team

4. **For CEO feedback**:
   - Gather examples across multiple reviews
   - Share pattern: "I've noticed we're consistently getting this type of feedback"
   - Explain your interpretation of why it matters to them
   - Explain how to apply across product going forward

**Magic Questions Technique**:

**To understand someone's thinking**:
- Don't ask: "Can you explain your mental model?"
- Instead: Make statements about what you think
- End with: "Is that right?" or "Do you agree?"
- Calibrate based on their yes/no

**When working with legal/compliance**:
- Don't ask: "Can you give me the rule?"
- Instead: "What if we did X? What if this is what it looked like? Would that be okay?"
- Tease out mental model by seeing what they say yes/no to

**Teaching your team**:
- When they ask "What should I do?"
- Say: "Tell me what you think you should do, then ask if I agree"
- Benefits: Calibrate judgment, don't become reliant

### Habit Formation for AI Adoption

**30 Days of GPT Approach**:

1. **Make it NOT about work**:
   - Remove pressure of deadlines and "getting it right"
   - Use for fun, simple use cases

2. **Examples of day 1 tasks**:
   - Come up with vacation times/places
   - Upload calendar, ask for meeting talking points
   - Things where all info is spelled out

3. **Design for early success**:
   - Custom GPTs where you write the prompt
   - They upload document → get specific output
   - Feel "This helps me" without "I'm bad at prompting" despair

4. **Create reward loops**:
   - Shout-outs in team meetings for creative AI use
   - Let people demo their solutions
   - Make them feel like a million bucks

5. **Consistency over intensity**:
   - Every single day, just 1-2 minutes
   - Build habit, not education program

### Reward Loop Design

**Three Requirements**:
1. **Powerful**: They feel like a million bucks
2. **Immediate**: Right after the behavior
3. **Emotional**: Not just transactional

**Examples**:
- Public recognition at right moment (when everyone's already in good mood)
- Demonstrate impact: Show how their behavior helped the team
- Connect to their identity: "This is who you are, this is what you value"

### Building Your Own Behavioral Activation List

**For when you feel walls closing in**:
- Pick up laundry off chair and put away
- Go for walk outside
- Call a friend
- Read something inspiring
- Work on a craft (illustration, writing, etc.)
- Exercise

**Key**: Action before motivation, not reverse

## 5. 反常识视角 (Expanded)

### Depression Insight Applied to Work

**Misconception**: "I'll feel better and then I'll act"
**Truth**: "I will act and then I will feel better"

**Application at work**:
- Same negative thinking patterns happen to non-depressed people
- Must identify actions to reverse spiral
- Easier said than done (especially if depressed), but principle holds

### Reading Fiction Builds Empathy

**Hilary's approach**: "What is the world of this person where the thing they're saying makes sense?"

**How she learned it**:
- A lot of frustration came from being frustrated with other people
- Making herself miserable and useless to company
- "I don't appreciate my perfect, unique, beautiful insight and everyone else has wrong opinions"

**Result**:
- Relationships become much richer
- Genuinely makes you a happier person
- Come from curiosity vs "That doesn't make sense"

### Success Criteria

**When is it working?**
- Team is making decisions you would make
- You don't need to read their emails
- You don't need to approve things
- When you don't have confidence they understand how you think → that's when you need to approve

**How to get there?**
- Share mental models weekly
- Teach magic questions technique
- Be transparent about your thinking
- Explain the why behind decisions
