# Geoff Charles - Ramp产品VP

**嘉宾简介**: Geoff Charles是Ramp产品VP，带领公司在2年内达到1亿美元ARR（史上最快增长的SaaS和B2B FinTech公司之一），仅用50人实现这一里程碑。

---

## 1. 核心议题 (The Questions)

- **Velocity文化**：如何在50人团队中2年构建Amex、Expensify、Bill.com的竞争对手产品？
- **Context over Control**：如何实现radical empowerment而不牺牲alignment？
- **少PM多产出**：13个PM如何支持100+工程师并保持超高velocity？
- **First Principles Thinking**：当商业模式前所未有时，如何从基本原则出发而非经验复制？

---

## 2. 核心洞察 (Core Conclusions)

### **Velocity即一切**
- **定义**：Velocity is everything at Ramp - 产品开发流程设计、团队激励、招聘、晋升、决策制定、组织架构
- **起源**：pandemic期间小团队+巨大市场机会 → not which path to pick but how fast we can execute
- **价值**：
  - 高velocity团队通过迭代获得impact
  - 正向selection（人才想加入shipping fast的公司）
  - 降低决策成本（decision cost really low）
- **实例**：
  - 加入时10人（8工程师）→ 3个月build Amex competitor
  - 6个月后build Expensify competitor
  - 达到1亿美元ARR时，R&D总人数<50（<4工程师，<3 PM）
  - Accounts Payable: 3工程师+1设计师+1PM → 3个月build Bill.com competitor → 如今年处理数十亿美元

### **Single-Threaded Teams + Shielding from Chaos**
- **Single-threaded含义**：one goal, one thread that they're waking up in the morning to focus on
- **实施**：
  - 移除所有outside that single goal的工作
  - 为团队save一个房间在办公室
  - they are just in that room all day every day just working on that one thing
- **保护机制**：
  - **Production Engineering轮值**：保护core team from escalations, bugs, issues
  - **Product Operators**：保护PM from documentation, escalations, release management, enablement, customer requests
  - **Layers of protective tissue**
- **时机**：big bets通常从zero to one（new products，no responsibility on existing products）；从one to two更challenging

### **Context over Control的实践**
- **CTO Karim的风格**：extremely hands-off on product decisions because extremely aligned on goals
- **对齐层级**（从upstream开始）：
  1. **目标**：What is the goal you're going after?
  2. **假设**：What is the hypothesis to reach that goal?
  3. **数据**：What is the data for that hypothesis?
  4. **解决方案**：What is the potential solution?
- **错误模式**：More junior leaders聚焦debating solutions而非upstream alignment
- **领导职责**：share context that teams might be missing（来自meetings/groups的context）→ teams make better decisions
- **Contract**：Strategy + Roadmap + Timing = contract between me and team
- **团队职责**：highlight risks + highlight one-way decisions that need my input

### **"Lofty Goals"的配方**
- **市场对比物激励**：Bill.com, Expensify, Concur, Coupa are publicly traded companies → very motivating and de-risks business decisions
- **设计愿景激励**：Spend time with designers crafting what the future could look like → constantly go back to Loom walkthroughs of Figma prototypes
- **收入驱动**：Very revenue driven as a company
- **结果**：Market + Revenue Goal + Design → stay motivated + move super fast

### **质量与Velocity的控制机制**
- **Voice of Customer流程**：Every single negative review shared to tech lead + PM + designer monthly
- **指标报告**：NPS, CSAT, Operational Overhead（tickets normalized by users）
- **Core Contract**：Team must maintain low/lower operational burden
- **Bug处理**：No bug backlog → fix every bug once surfaced（production engineer's job）
- **UX改进控制**：If "customers confused" metric elevated → "You can't ship any new features, you need to fix these things"
- **标准化合同**：As long as you maintain these metrics（operational burden %, CSAT, NPS, confused customers），you can do whatever you want. The moment these are in the red, you can't ship new features

### **Empowerment的前提条件**
- **CEO-less-opinionated**：CEO sets vision but much less opinionated about specific sequence → trusts radically empowered tech organization
- **消除status meetings**：Never had a status meeting → statuses done async in systems → in real time
- **专注Collaboration**：Meetings should be all about collaboration, ideation, decision-making
- **明确tradeoffs**：Present tradeoffs back to leadership："Here's what we're doing and here's what we're not doing and why. Which one would you pick?"
- **Execution faster on 4 things rather than 8 at the same time**
- **领导者参与**：Founder commenting "This is awesome" on random project channel → general excitement on building great cool shit

## 3. 心法与原则

- **"Any second you spend planning is a second you don't spend doing"**：优先velocity而非planning accuracy
- **"Velocity避免burnout"**：Burnout发生在最低velocity时期（大量努力但没有moving）。High velocity → flow state → work becomes thrilling
- **"Meaningful to you, not your boss"**：管理层的职责是让每个人都觉得it's their goal。如果everyone feels like it's their team/mini company → radically avoid burnout
- **"Every support ticket is a failure of our product"**：First principle for support team（reports to product）
- **"I should never really be in the critical path of anything"**：largely not available, but if really need → have my phone number
- **"Reading makes you more wise, but the best way to increase your capacity to think is to actually do the thinking"**：Writing helps thinking clearly
- **"Create or free up headspace for processing, not memory"**：Spend very little time memorizing, write everything down

## 4. 实战手册

### **战略文档（Strategy Document）结构**
1. **目标（Goals）**：What do you want to see in the world?
2. **假设（Hypothesis）**：Why do you think this will work?
3. **独特定位（Uniquely Positioned）**：Why are we uniquely positioned as a company to get after that goal?
4. **指标（Metrics）**：By what metrics would you measure whether we reach that goal?
5. **举措（Initiatives）**：Talk about the initiatives
6. **风险（Risks）**：Talk about the risks
7. **长期成果（Long-term Outcomes）**：Talk about the long-term outcomes

### **Planning演进**
- **早期错误**：Quarterly OKRs with financial goals + quotas → took one month every three months planning（33% time planning）→ very political, very annoying → R&D team: "We're just going to execute on the roadmap, screw the OKRs"
- **现在**：Biannual one-pager on company priorities + strong financial plan（每个row/lever有owner）
- **Two contracts**：
  1. Financial plan（product-led rows have product owner）
  2. Roadmap
- **Large market moments**：需要accuracy的计划（products + marketing + sales coordinating）→ once a quarter or once every six months（marketing calendar）

### **OKR态度**
- **Product perspective**：Stay away from OKRs → Focus on velocity（output = roadmap）
- **Cross-functional perspective**：Strong for OKRs（winning specific market, cross-functional across teams）
- **Financial perspective**：Strong for OKRs
- **原因**：Can't ask every team to manipulate OKRs to fit their roadmaps（completely exhausting）

### **First Principles招聘**
- **关键特征**：
  - Strong desire to have impact（leaving because things got too slow/bureaucratic, missed building/shipping/launching）
  - Can think deeply（super deep into a decision/tradeoff they had to make）
  - Overemphasize these two skills rather than experience（Ramp is unique business, experience matters less）
- **工程师A-plus信号**：
  - Want to win in market/win hearts and minds of customer
  - Understand business context
  - Curious about how company makes money, what customers love/don't love, what's most important project and why
  - Ask questions about business outside engineering domains
  - Execute without help vs. need you behind them
  - Set the pace, asking you to keep up with specs/decisions/response
  - Proactive in different channels（jumping into Slack channels explaining features, getting feedback, fixing bugs）
  - If product not performing, do it themselves or need you to push?

### **Break into Product Management路径**
- **Adjacent roles**：Product operations, Business operations, Consulting, Sales engineering, Solution engineering
- **Typical path**：Highest performers outside product who either understand customer really well or understand product very well
- **Trial**：Give them 6 months to try out → engineers and designers they work with make the call

### **PM核心职责（在高velocity环境）**
- **Strategy + Vision + Alignment**
- **Team building**：Build culture within pod（engineers/designers/PMs report to different people）→ create offsites, ideation sessions, find ways to have fun as team
- **Protecting the team**：Protect from stakeholders wanting opinion/updates/meetings → being central point of contact
- **Not writing tickets**：Never write tickets, don't spend much time in Linear（ticket management system）→ contract is vision + priority + high-level spec → engineering teams create tickets, breakdown work

### **Task管理系统**
1. **End of every meeting**：Write down tasks I owe + tasks someone else owes（as clearly as possible + when need to get done by）
2. **End of day**：Use Notes → page-long thing of all things to get done + things people need to get done for me
3. **Grooming**：Group things in logical chunks（tactical vs. strategic, important vs. less important）
4. **Other people's tasks**：Slack them what they owe me + put reminder on Slack for when they owe it by → out of sight, out of mind
5. **Next day calendar**：Aligned to goals set day before（group tactical tasks together + strategic deep thinking blocks）

### **Deep Work时间管理**
- **Friday before clocking out**：Look at next week → look at top questions need to spend time thinking about → block out that time
- **Weekend work**：One day of weekend for deep work（hanging out outside + doodling on piece paper with thoughts → doesn't feel like work, feels like philosophizing）
- **Space**：Early mornings or later afternoons or day on weekend（not in critical path）
- **Policy**："I should never really be in the critical path of anything" → largely not available, but if really need → have my phone number

## 5. 反常识视角

- **"Velocity防止burnout"**：Burnout发生在最低velocity而非highest velocity时期（努力但没有moving的感觉最糟糕）
- **"Support reports to Product"**：Every support ticket is a failure of our product → Better way of holding product team accountable
- **"No bug backlog"**：Fix every bug once surfaced almost（vs. prioritizing bugs）
- **"Experience matters less than hunger + deep thinking"**：Overemphasize desire to have impact + ability to think deeply rather than experience
- **"Engineers should challenge PMs"**：I'll take someone who challenges what I tell them any day vs. taking things at face value → makes me think way deeper about what I'm asking
- **"Chaos is good"**：Implicit contract joining Ramp - prioritize velocity over almost everything else → somewhat chaotic, ship things that don't work, change products without fully enabling you, constantly on toes
- **"Reading doesn't make you think better"**：Reading makes you more wise, but best way to increase capacity to think is to actually do the thinking（writing helps thinking clearly）

## 6. 花絮与细节

### **个人习惯与工具**
- **不读非虚构**：Try to read things completely outside work（pull on heartstrings, make you more human）
- **推荐书籍**：《When Breath Becomes Air》（非虚构推荐）
- **推荐剧集**：《The Bear》（leadership, restaurant industry, teamwork, quality vs. velocity）
- **健康工具**：WHOOP（real-time stress signal, daily journal of actions correlated to recovery score/health via heart rate variability）
- **生产力建议**：Turn off notifications, quit Slack when doing deep work, check emails once a day（5 minutes），check Slack only at top of hour, use Slack snooze/reminders, get really good at tools you use
- **面试问题**："What's the hardest thing you've ever done?"（Understand what hard means, why it was hard, how they overcame, how they worked with others, how much agency they had）

### **Support Team的First Principles创新**
- **Quote**："Every support ticket is a failure of our product"（posted on all channels）
- **假设**：If product works perfectly, no one should ever have to contact support
- **激励转变**：Instead of hiring people focused on resolving tickets → incentivize people to decrease number of tickets over time + increase deflection
- **结果**：Over 400,000 users + under 30 agents = extremely low contact rate

### **Writing作为思考工具**
- **方法**：Shut down laptop, take out piece of paper, write question as simply as possible at top, spend time thinking about how to answer
- **解决的问题**：How do we scale decision making? How do we incentivize teams to work together? How do we do headcount planning? How do we allocate headcount in fair way? How do we avoid politics as first-hand data goes away? How do we make decisions on doubling down vs. pivoting?
- **顺序**：Do the thinking first → then go out and read → fine-tune thinking + identify new questions
- **用途**：Effectively communicate（especially during COVID where everything was written）+ get content out there to increase brand → hire better people

### **PM ratio与leverage**
- **当前**：13 PMs, 100+ engineers（1:8 to 1:15 ratio）
- **B2B特殊性**：Slightly lower ratio than B2C because dealing with strong marketing/sales teams + demanding customers
- **高leverage方法**：
  1. **让其他人像PM一样思考**：Empower designer to think about specs/priorities/scopes, empower engineer to take lightweight spec/direction and think deeply + come back with great questions PM hasn't thought through
  2. **Product Operations早期投资**：Team reporting to Geoff focusing on operational functions（project management, issue management, release management, enablement, content beta, customer research）
  3. **Cut low-leverage work**：Never write tickets, don't spend much time in Linear（ticket management）→ contract is vision + priority + high-level spec → everything else pushed to engineering teams

### **联系信息**
- **Twitter/X**：@geoffintech
- **LinkedIn**：Geoff Charles
- **招聘**：Hiring across product/engineering/design

### **最终建议**
- **Think from first principles**：Don't take everything said at face value
- **Talent is everything**：Early team（CTO Karim built）huge part of success → first year only focused on hiring best engineers/designers（not product strategy/product market fit/revenue）→ compounding effects
- **Be kind to yourself**：Keep growth mindset, keep thinking from first principles, keep investing in growth, be patient（takes a lot of time）
