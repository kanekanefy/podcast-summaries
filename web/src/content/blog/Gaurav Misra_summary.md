## 1. 核心议题 (The Questions)

- 当**一切皆有可能**的时代，如何保持专注并选择正确的产品方向？
- **每周一个可市场化功能**的工程团队如何运作而不牺牲质量？
- 为什么需要**秘密路线图（Secret Roadmap）**与公开路线图并存？
- Snap如何通过**设计师主导产品**、零PM模式实现持续创新？

---

## 2. 核心洞察 (Core Conclusions)

### **"Once-in-a-lifetime Moment"的产品机遇**
- **5-7年前**：创业极难，everything feels like it's done, someone else is working on it
- **现在**：everything you try just works，there's more things that can be done than there's people available to do them
- **科学fiction变成现实**：Iron Man的J.A.R.V.I.S.、Interstellar的TARS——literally science fiction has become reality and nobody cares
- **反常识**：adoption is much slower than tech circles think——即使是最exciting things，takes a while to get out there

### **"每周一个可市场化产品"的工程哲学**
- **可市场化产品定义**：a product that you can show to users and the user might subscribe or pay for the app just for that
- **vs. Table stakes features**：auto format, justify alignment——nobody's going to come to your word processor for justify alignment
- **范围削减艺术**：
  - 错误做法：when time is pressured downward, engineers cut on quality rather than cutting on scope
  - 正确做法：look at every element → "what if we remove this? Is the product still useful?" → repeat until removing any more would make it useless
- **示例**：Add image to video feature
  - 设计版本：import from camera roll → background removal → hue/saturation → cloud/drive picker
  - 一周版本：cut all → native picker from camera → straight into video → no UI
  - **核心逻辑**：If the core isn't useful, anything built on top is also useless

### **技术债务即杠杆**
- **反常识观点**：As a startup, your job is to take on technical debt because that is how you operate faster than a bigger company
- **类比**：Financial debt is taken on to create leverage（like buying a house）
- **计算公式**：
  - 每笔债务需要支付利息：1-2% of your time每天在维护bugs、issues、restarts、crashes
  - 债务过多 = 80-90% interest = "we're just keeping the lights on" = startup failure case
  - **技术债务跑道**：once you run out of it, if you haven't delivered enough value to hire engineers to pay the interest → trouble
- **决策框架**：Is this a problem we need to solve today or is this a problem that the 50th/100th/500th engineer can solve？
- **未来工程师**：may be an AI agent engineer

### **双路线图战略**
- **公开路线图（Public Roadmap）**：
  - 用户反馈需求：background removal, undo/redo, upload longer videos
  - **特征**：every competitor knows about（如果用户问你，他们也在问所有人）
  - **价值**：extra nicely prioritizing or winning a little in execution → not a game changer
- **秘密路线图（Secret Roadmap）**：
  - **来源**：nobody has ever asked for it，user might say "I don't need this. I don't know what this is."
  - **生成**：quarterly brainstorming, company-wide（engineering, recruiting, marketing all included）→ vote/rank ideas → product team assesses feasibility
  - **标准**：基于独特vantage point + unique understanding of problem set + user space + technology
  - **目标**：completely revolutionize how something is used → change user behavior → once they try it, they never go back
- **最大胜利来源**：biggest wins will come from the secret roadmap

### **Snap的"设计师即PM"模式**
- **组织结构**：
  - 10-12个设计师（即使在5000-6000员工时）
  - 长期无PM（PMs were introduced with monetization）
  - 这些设计师"actually PMs as well"
- **设计师的双重职责**：
  - 设计能力（IC designers，no reports）
  - PM职责：figure out the roadmap, write all documents, work with different teams, figure out shipping schedules, know technical + engineering + UX + UI + product needs + why are we doing this
  - **高工作量 + 高薪酬**：quarterly bonuses, paid way higher than designers/PMs/engineers
- **Evan Spiegel的granular control**：
  - 能keep the context of the entire app in his head
  - knew interdependencies and what we're doing and why
  - everything UI needed to be approved by Evan
  - meet with 10-12 people → know every user-impacting change
- **设计工程团队（Design Engineering）**：
  - 创造原因：as company gets bigger（500-3000 engineers）→ every product is massive investment of 500 engineers for a year → if you get it wrong → big problem
  - **职能**：people who can do the entire product + design + engineering process in their head → put together early versions → bake into Snapchat app → test in Australia or couple high schools
  - **意外收获**：create alignment by causing internal virality → share the build → explodes inside company → hear from engineers → managers → VPs → Evan："Oh my god, everyone's talking about this. Why am I the last one to hear about it?"

## 3. 心法与原则

- **"The easiest way to be the best is to be first"**：to win → be the best → easiest way to be the best is to be first
- **"质量 vs. 范围"**：when time is pressured, cut scope not quality
- **"技术债务是朋友"**：strategic technical debt creates leverage to build products you wouldn't be able to build with a small team
- **"秘密路线图是game-changer"**：用户需求不是差异化来源，基于独特洞察的创新才是
- **"Complaint is validation"**：If nobody complains, it's almost red flag
- **"设计师+工程师+PM的融合"**：innovation happens at the intersection of crafts when one person can do multiple functions
- **"PM应该拥有营销"**：marketing is expanding the surface area of the product → search marketing is placing a button to your product in Google → same skillset

## 4. 实战手册

### **每周shipping工作流**
1. **设计阶段**：
   - 设计完整功能
   - 开始cut, cut, cut until removing any more would make it useless
2. **开发阶段**：
   - 一周内完成MVP（truly minimal）
   - 不追求完美，但必须work
3. **发布阶段**：
   - 展示给用户
   - 收集complaints
4. **迭代阶段**：
   - 下一周shipping所有用户complaining about的东西
   - **用户抱怨即产品方向**："This sucks. It doesn't even have background removal. What kind of image thing is this?"
   - 结果：people are like "wow, this team is shipping like crazy. Solve all my problems. So responsive."

### **双模式产品开发**
- **PM-first approach**：finding overall issue/pillar → creating product specs
- **Design-first approach**：design a bunch of things without knowing what/why → sit with PMs → go over one and the next → find interesting things/ideas that pop out
- **价值**：discover things we wouldn't have discovered if we were just too focused on metrics and numbers

### **基础设施季度**
- Q4 = infrastructure quarter
- spend all time paying technical debt
- 已经delivered ton of products，feeling pretty good about the year
- things winding down for holidays

### **优先级框架**
1. **寻找virality**：what has virality = something interesting at the core
2. **识别核心**：may not be repeated use case or subscription business, but oftentimes some core element has resonated
3. **塑造成商业**：identify that core → mold it into fitting into your business
4. **社交媒体测量**：talk about idea → people will share it → measure how well product might be received even before building

### **AI工具栈**
- **Cursor**：everybody's using it，huge multiplier
- **Devin**：$500/month，AI engineer in Slack，solving bugs
- **优势**：startups can pull in Devin immediately，bigger companies need 30 lawyers in the room first
- **未来**：manager of Devins who's managing Devins

## 5. 反常识视角

- **"反常识的黄金时代"**：
  - 5-7年前：创业极难
  - 现在：everything you try just works
  - **但**：getting people to pay attention is harder than ever
- **"科学fiction被忽视"**：
  - J.A.R.V.I.S.、TARS literally exist
  - would've expected world to be turned upside down
  - feels almost shockingly slow adoption
- **"技术债务是杠杆"**：
  - 大公司pay debt right away or paying back from startup days
  - 创业公司should take on debt to operate faster
  - 类似financial debt for buying house
- **"社交网络的二分法"**：
  - 传统社交网络：share with friends（friend sharing virality时代已结束）
  - 新时代：algorithm deciding whether your content is worth showing（TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels）
  - **监管视角**：应该被视为不同类别（一边是用户决定谁看什么，另一边是公司决定——semi-curated，公司voice）
- **"Snap错失TikTok的哲学原因"**：
  - Our Stories = early TikTok，high engagement，died out
  - 原因：against algorithmic ranking → curation team looking through every single one → not scalable
  - **原因2**：against mission（enable private sharing in safe way）→ public sharing enables bullying
  - **mission-based decisions**：if it's outside scope, we don't do it no matter what the cost, no matter how exciting

## 6. 花絮与细节

### **Captions的"失败"故事**
- **初期**：两天build Captions app → launch → immediately took off（top of app store, 600 videos/day）
- **反应**："Wait, this can't be it, right? It can't be this fast. How did this happen?"
- **错误**：got distracted → spent year and a half thinking about building social networks when should've been working on Captions
- **发现**：1.5年后打开personal account → $500,000 in there → revenue growing completely on its own → no employees, no releases, no bug fixes, no customer support（2000 open support tickets unanswered for 1.5 years）→ great reviews
- **转向**：reset → back on track with Captions → as soon as started releasing first features → blew up
- **Hockey stick moment**：old vertical line became horizontal line → new vertical line so vertical that the old vertical line became horizontal

### **个人习惯与偏好**
- **不读书哲学**：decided don't want to build skill in reading → want to build it in listening and watching instead → "that's the future"
- **喜欢的节目**：Silo, Severance
- **喜欢的工具**：Linear（so well-designed, so easy to use）, Superhard
- **生活哲学**：The easiest way to be the best is to be first

### **推荐与联系**
- **LinkedIn**：find me on LinkedIn, DMs open
- **招聘**：building out early product and design team
- **筛选**：people excited about "ship a marketable feature every week" = great fit；people stressed out by that = not the place

### **Eye Contact功能案例**
- **功能**：shift your eyes to look at the camera（reading from script/teleprompter off-screen）
- **创新**：first company to build this，worked with Nvidia
- **Nvidia反应**：not sure why we needed this → gave it pretty openly → excited about partnership
- **市场反应**：ad demonstrating this went so viral → made in basically every language around the world → still today gets millions of views → reposts and reposts with millions and millions and millions of views
- **结果**：been copied the hell out of, available on basically every app

### **AI视频的未来**
- **文档 vs. 故事**：
  - **文档**：personal video with friends, reporter documenting crime/natural disaster → no benefit to AI-generated video, all negative → stay away, design products that make it difficult to use for this
  - **故事**：ads, social media posts, TV, movies → designed for entertainment/fun → nobody thinks gecko is real → pure positive to enable more people to tell stories
- **Talking video focus**：
  - B-roll vs. dialogue/monologue
  - Avatar companies（neural rendering）vs. large generative models
  - Captions focus：large generative models for talking videos
- **ByteDance OmniHuman**：first large model example from big company for dialogue/monologue videos → highly expressive, doesn't look like avatar

### **AI视频营销作为前沿**
- **一年前**：run AI video in ads → comments："Oh my god, this is so fake. Don't show me this."
- **现在**：technology got good enough → comments stopped → performance better than recording with person
- **优势**：
  - Try 30-40 possibilities → one wins more than single creative from person
  - Localization：translate with AI → performance almost as good as original in original language
- **必然性**：wherever there's dollars to be made/saved → it is inevitable → it will be consumed
- **反乌托邦预测**：social network of future where all content is generated, none of the people are real, algorithm purely generating content completely catered to you → "not out of the question, almost seems inevitable, possibly real in five years"
