## 嘉宾简介
Tristan de Montebello是Ultraspeaking的联合创造者,这是Lenny遇到过的最好的公开演讲workshop。2017年,Tristan成为世界演讲锦标赛最快进入决赛的竞争者。基于那个经验,他建立了一个非常独特的课程,帮助你快速建立技能成为更好和更舒适公开演讲,特别是现场演讲。

## 核心议题

2. **享受即指标** - 如果你不享受说话,你就做错了
3. **潜意识流程vs conscious控制** - 说话是subconscious flow导向过程
4. **三个immediate战术** - 思考vs看下、结束strong、保持角色
5. **游戏化练习** - 通过游戏学习技能

## 核心洞察(比喻/英文术语)

### Meta Skill(元技能)
**"Speaking is not a specialized skill, it's a meta skill"**
- 这意味着你越get better at speaking,你的生活gets better
- **Fitness例子**: 如果你开始transform你的fitness,开始举重和跑步,肌肉会变大,你会get更多shape,心血管系统会改善
- 但那实际上只是impact的sliver
- 你会开始feeling more energy,开始有这些nice hormones,这些endorphins flowing through your body
- 你会开始feeling better about yourself
- 当你走在镜子前面,突然你会have a boost in confidence
- **Naturally,你生活的其他一切会开始改善**
- **Speaking是same**: 当你开始making breakthroughs in speaking,其他东西开始feeling different
- 你在工作中feeling如何feels different
- 你在朋友群中feeling如何feels different
- 你在陌生人群体中feeling如何feels different,especially
- 你甚至可以在家庭中feeling如何被impact
- **This seeps into你生活的其他一切**

### 自我意识下的extraordinary superpower
**"因为作为人类,我们进化到说话,这是what we are"**
- 你不需要教婴儿如何说话,他们会自己learn with no formal education
- 那意味着,我们都有这个incredible hardware
- 但有这么多self-consciousness伴随着speaking
- 我们经常feel kind of constraints under the layers of overthinking and anxiety伴随着speaking
- 所以可能很难realize that underneath these layers,你实际上have this extraordinary superpower

### 享受即barometer(Enjoyment as Barometer)
**"如果我做事情right,我可能enjoying myself。如果我做事情wrong,particularly with speaking"**
- 因为again,这是something we're naturally evolved to do
- 所以如果我们naturally evolved to do it,这不是something we dislike doing
- 它必须be something that rewards us
- **As soon as事情开始not feeling enjoyable,这是一个sign,嘿,我可能doing this wrong,guy**
- **有一些东西在这里我making这unenjoyable可能not helping我**
- 伟大communicators在business看起来feel very comfortable
- 看起来feel like themselves
- 如果你think about speaking,当你和你的kids、partner、best friend、childhood friend、parents谈话时
- 我们都有environments我们feel completely like ourselves
- 当我们do,communication是extraordinarily enjoyable
- 它只是means去connect with other people,means去share我们have on our mind
- 非常empowering和feels very good
- 然后我take same person with same skill set和same ability
- 我bring他们in a business setting
- 突然我不feel like myself了
- 因为of the pressure,I start trying to speak differently
- 人们开始having,我要try to think very hard of我需要say什么
- 我want to control the words会出来of my mouth before they come出来of my mouth
- 所以我make sure我不make a mistake
- 你basically loop在这个东西中
- 这是so counter什么是communication,which is just a natural subconscious scale
- **Using speaking as a barometer of:嘿,如果这not feeling good,我可能overthinking。我可能need to relax和try to just feel a little bit more like myself**

### Subconscious Flow-Oriented Process(潜意识流程导向过程)
**"我理解speaking是a subconscious flow-oriented process和not a conscious process的那天,完全改变了我approach它的方式"**
- 所以不是thinking tactics和frameworks和adding更多to the outside of things我need to think about
- 当我realized when I speak best,我实际上not thinking about speaking
- 它是the last thing我think about是the speaking part
- 我完全in tune with whatever it is我trying to convey to my audience或the person in front of me
- **The goal是去get into a flow state和stay in that flow state all the way through the finish line**
- That's what really,really changed了我mindset about speaking
- 因为then它changes all the exercise,练习你want to do
- 它changes how你can think about speaking

### Root Causes vs Symptoms(根本原因vs症状)
**"One of the ways它changed how I practiced是,instead of focusing on the symptoms of speaking,I started to try和figure out,well,什么是the root causes那create these symptoms,和我can I address those?"**
- 所以不是counting my filler words,如果是something那是annoying to me
- 我要go back和try to figure out,well,什么是the root cause of that?
- Well,有lots of filler words的root cause或racing in your speaking,是you probably struggle to feel comfortable slowing down,relaxing,或even pausing当你mind is racing和你feel pressure
- **Solve that,not only do the filler words take care of themselves,but the racing takes care of itself和你突然have more mind space**
- 如果你feel super constrained in your speaking,非常monotonous,那么maybe你feel boxed in和你struggling to allow yourself to feel to be all of what you are under pressure
- 因为probably有a lack of certainty
- **A lack of trust in:嘿,如果我let myself be more intense或如果我let一些of these emotions pop out,或如果我take a time to gather my thoughts,是everything going to unravel,或is that going to work for me?**
- 如果你have not proven that to yourself,那么你just going to go for safety
- 所以你going to be very monotonous和constrained,和那creates monotony
- **But if I can solve that,突然I have freedom**
- 所以thinking through这个和understanding那the goal here是upgrading the software
- 和它really layering,taking all the bad habits away和putting in new habits那I can just stay in this flow state without getting pulled out
- 那really changes the game

### Three Immediate Tactics(三个immediate战术)

#### 1. Think Up, Not Look Down(思考vs看下)
**"Makes you look better"**
- 人们当trying to gather their thoughts或thinking,look down
- 如果你在Zoom上looking down,是three times as bad
- 因为它looks like你're looking at你的phone或looking at notes如果你had any
- 但even when你're in person,它doesn't look very confident
- 所以你suddenly giving off of那vibe of:哦,这person feels a little bit uncertain here
- 和maybe it's going to look like你stopped speaking和你might get more interrupted
- **If instead你switch那up和你start thinking up**
- I think up into the right,但你can think in any direction你want
- 但as long as你're looking up,你actually look thoughtful by default
- 所以突然你looking thoughtful
- 那意味着你look more confident因为anyone who'd be willing to pause in their speaking是somebody who's confident
- 和as a result,你much less likely to get interrupted
- **所以这是一个small tweak但makes a real difference**

#### 2. End Strong(结束strong)
**"Makes you sound better"**
- 人们tend to give一个great answer和then either他们kind of taper off在the end,这doesn't leave你with a good impression
- 或they'll actively say那doubts那are coming up在他们的mind of maybe他们'll be giving一个great answer和then suddenly他们say,"I don't really know if那makes sense"
- **End strong意思是staying in character**
- 在speaking中,它是same thing
- 人们tend to give一个great answer和then either他们kind of taper off在the end或they'll actively say那doubts

#### 3. Stay in Character(保持角色)
**"Makes you feel better"**
- 人们tend to self-sabotage a lot在speaking
- 显然当我speaking,我all of my senses是really,really heightened
- 所以I'm aware of everything如果一个word comes出来a little bit weird或if it's not the word那I was expecting to hear come出来of my mouth
- 我going to be very aware of that因为我was expecting something和something different happens
- But那happens all the time当speaking
- 我starting to not make as much sense或I feel like我'm rambling,going a little bit too long
- **All of这些create insane noise在the back of my mind,那insecurities**
- 和你have a choice在那里,因为我can tell你right now,nobody can tell
- **People cannot see what你feel,even though它feels那way当你feel really,really strongly,but人们can't see it**
- 你just looking like一个normal speaker,competent和confident
- But internally,它feels like everybody can see
- 和你expect everybody在the end to say,"Oh my God,你looked so uncomfortable,什么是happening?"
- But人们can't see that,你look confident
- 所以他们just going to give你那reaction那a confident person would get
- 和你going to notice,哦wow,我am coming off as confident,和那going to make你feel more confident
- **所以它是a very reinforcing cycle**
- 如果你start staying in character和ending strong,naturally,你going to be reinforced by这behavior和你going to realize,哦,I didn't need to break character
- 我didn't need to hedge every time我spoke,和那going to give你much more confident
- 和你going to start realizing,人们just look confident by default
- **这是一个crazy thing。我want everybody to walk around那world和look at人们和think,most of the people我'm looking at实际上是nervous right now**
- 你going to look at他们和like,I can't tell
- 大多数people speaking up在meetings是feeling a level of nervousness,但你can't tell除非它是through那roof

### Speaking Games(演讲游戏)
**"我们做这些游戏,他们play那games那help你actually learn这些skills"**
- 我们going to show人们how你do那
- 我们going to do一些of那exercises那我们use在class
- 所以在我们get到实际tactics那可以just give人们to become better public speakers
- 我们going to做interactive,所以我们actually going to do一些of那games那我们use在class
- 这不是关于frameworks和tactics
