## 核心议题

1. **PM技能发展的IQ vs EQ两阶段** - 早期职业应focus on哪些hard skills,后期需要develop哪些soft skills?
2. **导师关系的建立与维护** - 如何find mentors,get them to say yes,build long-term mutually beneficial relationships?
3. **反馈的艺术** - 如何ask for,act on,和learn from feedback,尤其是关于EQ技能的blind spots?
4. **优势导向发展** - 为什么focus on strengths比fixing weaknesses更effective,如何identify your true strengths?

## 核心洞察

### 新颖洞察

- **"Practice so much that even at your worst,you're good enough"** - Interviewing advice但applies broadly to skill building。做dozens of mock interviews即使worst performance也能pass。同样logic for learning skills: overprepare so that bad day still meets bar

- **"Feedback patterns reveal your strengths and weaknesses"** - 如果multiple people tell you同样thing(e.g.,"you sound junior when you ask questions"),that's likely a strength (asking questions) with shadow side (lacking context). Strength和weakness是dial,不是binary

- **"Most people don't do mock interviews"** - 零mocks到practicing with peers是huge gap。Interviewing是skill需要deliberate practice,不只是reading articles。同样适用于任何skill: active practice > passive consumption

- **"Underrepresented folks face double burden in interviews"** - 高压力+高模糊+panel中nobody looks like you + internal self-talk("do I even want to work here?")。需要practice到even at worst也能pass的程度

### 具体比喻

- **"Strengths are like fish in water"** - 问:"What's something people keep saying you're good at but you think is not a big deal?" Fish would say "swimming? Duh,doesn't everybody?" - that's how you know it's strength。What's obvious to you but special to others = your superpower

- **"Questions without context sound junior"** - Jules的例子:He asks great questions但sometimes without showing his understanding,comes across as junior。Shadow of strength (asking) becomes weakness (lack of perceived expertise)

- **"Feedback like a mirror"** - Need someone to hold up mirror to see your patterns。Lawrence Ripsher told Jules "when you're thinking,you're just quiet" and shared what goes on in his head ("he's not interested")。That's how Jules discovered his stress pattern

- **"Learning EQ is like lifting weights"** - Unlike IQ skills (3-6个月可见progress),EQ需要持续daily/weekly practice。Stop practicing → atrophy again。It's a muscle not a one-time certification

### 保留的英文术语

- **T-shaped generalist** - Know a little about a lot (finance,business,product) with deep expertise in one area
- **Window of tolerance** (来自其他episode但relevant)
- **Deliberate practice** - Not just doing but practicing with intention and feedback
- **Growth mindset** - Carol Dweck的概念,面试时test for this
- **Active listening** vs. **Listening to solve problem** - 两种不同listening pattern

---

## 心法与原则

1. **"Start with IQ,layer on EQ"** - Early career: focus on execution,product sense,strategy,interviewing。Later as you manage people/lead cross-functional: add communication,leadership,management skills

2. **"One skill at a time,go all in"** - Pick one skill (e.g.,strategy),give yourself 3-6 months,do something related every week。Example:每周read one strategy doc from company,20 weeks = see 80% of patterns。Not "done" but to level where can switch focus

3. **"Strengths-based development > weakness fixation"** - Your comparative advantage comes from leveraging what you're naturally great at。Find your "fish doesn't know it's swimming" strengths,figure out how to maximize them

4. **"Make smallest ask possible"** - When reaching to mentors,ask question answerable in 2 minutes via email,not "can we have a call?"。Foot in door → follow up with impact → build relationship

5. **"Enthusiastic gratitude unlocks more feedback"** - When someone gives you (especially critical) feedback,your response MUST be "Thank you so much,this is super helpful!" even if internally melting。Show you like feedback → get more feedback → get better

## 实战手册

### PM技能发展路线图

**Phase 1: IQ Skills (Early Career - First 1-3 years)**
Focus areas:
- **Execution** - Ship things,drive results,learn by doing
- **Product Sense** - Develop intuition for what works
- **Strategy** - Learn frameworks,best practices
- **Interviewing** - Critical skill because can't get great jobs without it

How to build:
- Pick one skill at a time (e.g.,6 months on strategy)
- Set forcing function: "Within 6 months I'll ship experiments that improve activation by X%"
- Work backwards: What do I need to learn? Who can teach me?
- Find mentors/experts for each skill
- Practice deliberately: mock interviews for interviewing,write strategy docs for strategy

**Phase 2: EQ Skills (Mid-Career - Promoting to Manager/Lead)**
Focus areas:
- **Communication** - Clarity,conciseness,storytelling,empathy for different audiences
- **Leadership** - Driving initiatives across teams,influence without authority
- **Management** - Managing your team,dealing with ambiguity,stress
- **Self-awareness** - Understanding your patterns under stress

Why harder:
- More individual (what you need to work on specific to you)
- Slower progress (years not months)
- Requires持续practice like lifting weights
- Harder to get feedback (people don't say it to your face)

**Balancing Both:**
- Don't wait until perfect at IQ before starting EQ
- But early career: bias toward IQ (get the job,prove yourself)
- Later career: bias toward EQ (scale through others)
- Always be building something

### Interviewing Skill Development

**Why It Matters:**
- You can't be great PM without getting into great companies
- Interviewing is separate skill from doing the job
- Underrepresented folks face higher pressure

**Deliberate Practice Plan:**

**Month 1: Build Foundation**
- Read all interview prep content for target companies
- Understand question types (product sense,analytical,behavioral,etc.)
- Watch example interview videos

**Months 2-3: Mock Interviews (Dozens)**
- Find practice partners (small groups of 3-5 going through same process)
- Even if mocks aren't with experts,still better than zero mocks
- If possible,practice with people at target companies

**Key Insight:**
- "Practice so much that even at your worst,you're good enough"
- You'll likely interview at your worst due to nerves
- Overprepare to compensate

**For Underrepresented Folks:**
- Find small group to practice with
- Makes it more fun
- Helps with nerves
- Build support network
- Recognize extra burden and plan for it

### Mentorship全流程

**Finding Mentors:**

**Step 1: Identify What You Need**
- Specific skill you're trying to improve (e.g.,growth,pricing,acquisitions)
- Look for two things: 1) Expert at that thing,2) Good at explaining it
- Example: Jules wanted to learn growth → found Bangaly Kaba (Facebook growth expert)

**Step 2: Make Smallest Possible Ask**
- Bad: "Can we have a call?" (too big)
- Good: "You spoke about finding product-market fit,what's an example of product created with that approach?" (answerable in 2 min via email)
- Goal: Get foot in door,show you'll make good use of their time

**Step 3: Circle Back with Impact**
- Apply the advice
- Follow up: "I applied your framework to X problem,here's where we landed"
- This is the key step most people miss
- Shows you value their time and can execute

**Step 4: Escalate Gradually**
- Later: "This next problem is more nuanced,can we grab 15 min?"
- Over time: Regular relationship develops
- Eventually: Friend/mentor,not transactional

**Alternative: Cold Outreach**
- Jules cold-emailed Shishir Metha (not clear who)
- Asked specific,clear question
- Shishir offered to speak at Black PMs event
- Shows specific questions can work even with cold outreach

**Working with Mentors:**

**Each Session:**
- Bring specific problem/context
- Show you've done homework
- Take notes (shows you value input)
- Ask: "Is there anything I can help you with?" (ways to give back)

**Between Sessions:**
- Apply what you learned
- Follow up with results
- Bring up previous conversations ("How's your daughter's college search going?")
- Make it feel like continuation,not transaction

**Long-term:**
- Eventually become peers
- Pay it forward
- Refer others to them
- Speak at events together

### 反馈的获取与运用

**How to Ask for Feedback:**

**Tactic 1: Be Specific**
- Bad: "How did it go?"
- Good: "I'm working on executive presence,did you feel that in this presentation? To what extent?"
- Specificity makes it easier to give useful feedback

**Tactic 2: Self-Critique First**
- "I feel like this presentation didn't go well because [specific reason].What do you think?"
- Shows you're aware and open
- Gives them something to react to

**Tactic 3: Ask for Subjective Feedback**
- "How do you come across to me?" (not "what did I do wrong?")
- "When I'm quiet and thinking,what goes on in your head?"
- This is the most valuable feedback (subjective,never volunteered)

**How to Receive Feedback:**

**The Golden Rule: Enthusiastic Gratitude**
- Your immediate response MUST be: "Thank you so much,this is super helpful!"
- Even if internally melting or defensive
- If you react defensively,they'll never give honest feedback again
- If you're enthusiastically grateful,you'll get more feedback

**Jules' Experience:**
- Learned this the hard way
- At Slack/Google,people know: "If you give Jules feedback,he'll say 'thank you' and mean it"
- Even when heart is melting inside ("I thought I got better at this")
- Externally: always enthusiastic gratitude

**How to Act on Feedback:**

**For Pattern Feedback:**
- Look for themes across multiple people
- Example: Multiple people said "you sound junior when asking questions"
- Investigation: Reveals you ask bluntly without showing your understanding
- Solution: Add context ("I noticed X,why Y?") before asking question

**For Blind Spots:**
- Jules' pattern: When stressed,withdraws and goes quiet
- Others perceive: "He's disengaged,not interested"
- Learned from mentor Lawrence who said "when you're quiet,I think 'he's not interested'"
- Now knows: When stressed,need to verbalize thought process ("I'm thinking through this,give me a moment")

**Practice Schedule:**
- One EQ skill at a time (3-6 months)
- Weekly: Something related to that skill (read docs,practice,get feedback)
- Example: Working on listening →每周practice in conversations,ask for feedback
- It's like lifting weights: daily/weekly practice,not one-time fix

### 优势识别与发展

**Finding Your True Strengths:**

**The Key Question:**
"What's something people keep saying you're good at but you yourself don't think is a big deal?"

**Jules' Examples:**
- "You're so good at networking" (but he's semi-introvert,doesn't see it as special)
- "You ask great questions" (he thinks "I just ask basic questions")
- "You simplify complex problems" (seems obvious to him)

**These are your superpowers because:**
- They come naturally to you (like fish swimming)
- You don't see them as special (everyone can do this,right?)
- Others recognize them as exceptional

**Understanding Shadow Sides:**

**Key Insight:**
"Strength and weakness is not binary. It's the same thing,just a dial."

**Jules' Example - Asking Questions:**
- **Strength**: Asks great questions,curious,simplifies problems
- **Shadow Side**: Sometimes asks without context,comes across as junior or less knowledgeable
- **Dial Up**: When need to learn,understand,solve
- **Dial Down**: When need to demonstrate expertise,lead

**Another Example - Simplifying:**
- **Strength**: Can take complex problem,create simple mental model
- **Shadow Side**: Until model forms,doesn't talk much (quiet while processing)
- **Dial Up**: When need to clarify,align team
- **Dial Down**: When need to show immediate engagement,participation

**How to Apply:**
- Identify your strength (using the question above)
- Figure out the underlying resource (for Jules,it's curiosity)
- Understand when it serves you (contexts where dial up)
- Understand when it hurts you (contexts where dial down)
- Practice adjusting the dial

**Leveraging for Career:**
- Put yourself in positions where your strength is key differentiator
- For Jules: jobs where asking questions,simplifying complexity valued
- Partner with people who complement your strength/weakness profile
- Don't try to be well-rounded (mediocre at everything)
- Be exceptional at fewer things (your strengths)

### EQ技能的具体发展方法

**Communication:**

**For Clarity/Conciseness:**
- Read Minto's Pyramid Principle
- Save great emails/exec updates in special folder
- Study patterns: what makes them clear?
- Practice: Write before important meetings,get feedback

**For Storytelling:**
- Learn to tell same story different ways for different audiences
- CEO cares about X,CFO about Y,engineering about Z
- Adapt emphasis not facts
- Watch great presenters,crash their meetings to see how they handle Q&A

**For Empathy:**
- Read *Connect* by Carole Robin (Stanford Touchy-Feely class inspired)
- Understand: "How do you make people feel heard?"
- Practice: Say back what you heard,ask for more info
- Matt Mochary episode advice applies here

**Self-Awareness:**
- Need mentors/coaches to "hold up mirror"
- Group coaching (Jules uses Pathways to Leadership)
- 1-on-1 coaching (also helpful)
- Identify patterns: "When I'm stressed,I [X]"

**Listening:**
- Two types: 1) Listening to solve problem (Jules good at this),2) Creating space for person (working on this)
- Practice: Don't seek information,just make space,make them feel heard
- Say back what you heard to confirm understanding

## 反常识视角

1. **"Interviewing is a skill separate from doing the job"** - Being great PM ≠ great at interviewing。Many amazing PMs terrible at interviews。Need deliberate practice like any skill。Underrepresented folks face higher burden (pressure,stress,ambiguity,nobody looks like you)

2. **"Most people do zero mock interviews"** - When Jules asks "how many mocks did you do?",answer usually zero。Reading about interviews ≠ practicing。Huge gap between passive prep and active practice。Same applies to any skill

3. **"EQ skills take years,not months"** - Unlike IQ (3-6个月可见progress),EQ需要持续practice like lifting weights。Stop → atrophy。Need daily/weekly practice,not "read article and done"

4. **"You don't find mentors,you build relationships over time"** - Don't ask "will you be my mentor?"。Start small,show you'll use their wisdom well,follow up with impact,escalate gradually。Most people happy to help if shown respect and that advice will be used

5. **"Underrepresented folks need to practice even more"** - Not just bias in hiring but psychological burden of being in room where nobody looks like you,internal self-talk while trying to solve complex problems。Need to overprepare to compensate

## 总结

Jules Walter的journey从Haiti到medical devices到Slack到YouTube,同时building nonprofits (Black PMs,CodePath),展现了intentional career development的power。His核心insights:

**On Skill Building:**
- Start with IQ (execution,product sense,strategy,interviewing) then add EQ (communication,leadership,management)
- One skill at a time,go all in for 3-6 months
- Deliberate practice > passive consumption
- Set forcing functions to ensure learning

**On Mentorship:**
- Don't ask "will you be my mentor?" - start with smallest possible ask
- Follow up with impact (show you used their advice)
- Build relationships over time,not transactions
- Most people happy to help if you respect their time

**On Feedback:**
- Enthusiastic gratitude is non-negotiable (even if internally melting)
- Ask specific questions,give self-critique first
- Subjective feedback (how I come across) most valuable but rarely volunteered
- Pattern recognition across multiple people = true blind spot

**On Strengths:**
- Find what others see as special but you think is obvious ("fish doesn't know it's swimming")
- Understand shadow side of strength (dial up/down)
- Leverage strengths,partner to complement weaknesses
- Don't try to be well-rounded

**On Inclusion:**
- Underrepresented folks face double burden in interviews (pressure,stress,no one looks like you)
- Need to practice more to compensate
- Building communities (Black PMs,CodePath) creates support networks
- "Alone in the room" is real challenge with real psychological impact

His approach是humble,practical,proven。从no network in Bay Area到building relationships with leaders like Bangaly Kaba,Lawrence Ripsher,Bradley Horowitz。方法不是secret而是consistent execution: smallest asks,show impact,follow up,build over time。

EQ development是lifelong journey不像IQ有clear completion point。但持续practice像lifting weights:会get stronger,会make progress,但never "done." That's okay - growth mindset means always learning。

Most actionable advice: Start today with one skill,one mentor ask,one feedback request。Small steps,consistent execution,compound over time。
