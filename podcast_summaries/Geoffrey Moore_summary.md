## 1. 核心议题 (The Questions)

- **为什么33年后人们仍未理解"跨越鸿沟"的核心教训**，仍重复造轮子？
- **从"任何客户我都要"到"极致聚焦细分市场"**——为什么这种反直觉的专注是唯一出路？
- **四个inflection points的GTB playbook**：early market → bowling alley → tornado → main street，每个阶段的具体打法是什么？
- **用错playbook的反噬效应**：为什么在错误阶段使用正确策略会"slow you down or kill you"？

---

## 2. 核心洞察 (Core Conclusions)

### **"Bonfire Analogy"（篝火比喻）**
- **鸿沟期的错误心态**："I just need more customers. I should take any customer I could find"因为需要revenue
- **比喻**：It's like taking a match and running it back and forth under a log. It's not going to light the log
- **正确做法**：Start fire by putting little kindling, little crumpled paper, and hold the match in one place until the fire starts
- **Adjacency的重要性**：If the fire（piece of kindling）is here but the log（next segment）is in the other room, that doesn't work
- **核心逻辑**：需要在一个细分市场**点燃足够的火**（market share leadership）→ 获得gravity和ecosystem → 然后adjacent expansion

### **Why Narrow Target Matters（Power来源）**
- **在disruptive innovation中的power来源**：
  1. **Lighthouse customer**：Can you get one or more customers who put you on the map？（"Did you know CIA used AWS?" → makes a story）
  2. **Viable repeatable business**：Can you create a repeatable business model？
  3. **Ecosystem形成条件**：Ecosystems form around market leaders, not the rest of us
- **Fish-to-Pond Ratio**：First pond/target segment should be something in next two years, if hit high growth rates, could be 30-50% market share → partners say "Whoa, if we serve that segment, got to work with these guys"
- **为什么不能同时做多个segment**：Like running in 3-4 primaries for presidential nomination → votes in Vermont don't count in New Hampshire
- **Peer effect机制**：Pragmatic people buy what they see their peers are buying. If peer one buys A, peer two buys B/C/D → no market leader, category goes sideways. But if 3/4 use iPhone → "Oh, I guess I'm supposed to get an iPhone"

### **Four Inflection Points & Their Playbooks**

#### **1. Early Market（早期市场）**
- **特征**：
  - Customers：Visionaries + Technology Enthusiasts
  - 他们as excited about you as you are
  - Want the demo, want to see the vision
  - "We believe what you believe"
- **关键成功因素**：
  - Executive sponsor with enough clout to fund this thing（no budget for you）
  - Marquee customer（Apple, Verizon, Mercedes - people have heard of）
  - Project model（every customer is a snowflake, needs ton of special services）
  - Throw extra labor to make them successful
- **定价**：Value-based（not discount）
- **Target formula**：**Big enough to matter, small enough to lead, good fit with your crown jewels**

#### **2. Bowling Alley（保龄球道）/ Crossing the Chasm**
- **特征**：
  - Target：Pragmatists in niche
  - "We need what you have"（not "we believe what you believe"）
  - 从project model → solution model
  - 从"talk about you" → "talk about them"
  - **Compelling reason to buy**（problem severe enough, solved in crummy deteriorating way）
- **关键打法**：
  - **Overcommit to their problem**：Ask probing questions about them（like doctor asking about pain）
  - **不give demo**：They don't want demo, want to talk about their pain
  - **目标**：Create viable repeatable business → 30-50% market share in segment
  - **Adjacency expansion**：
    - Same customer + different use case（use customer references）
    - Same use case + different customer base（use partners）
- **Revenue potential**：Tens of millions to hundreds of millions（specialized industries can go to billions）

#### **3. Tornado（龙卷风）/ Inside the Tornado**
- **特征**：
  - "We want what they have. This is really cool"
  - Category goes horizontal（Wifi isn't just for financial analysts, it's for everybody）
  - Budget established（budget already has your name on it）
  - 从"We need what you have" → "We want what they have"
- **关键打法**：
  - **Want sales coverage**（vs. niche experts）
  - **Go broad**（vs. narrow focus）
  - **Standard product**（vs. customized solution）
  - **Capture as much market share as possible**
  - **Ecosystem forms around market share leader**
  - **Gorilla game**：If not #1 → retreat to niche（chimp = local gorilla, e.g., Juniper to telcos）

#### **4. Main Street（主街）**
- **特征**：
  - Products commoditized
  - Services become new place of innovation
  - "I don't want to own the product. I just want to call Uber"
  - Convert product to service（taxis for 100 years → Uber）
- **关键打法**：
  - **Expand**（vs. land）
  - Product-led growth works here（low risk extensions）
  - Service innovation

### **Positioning Formula（定位公式）**
- **For Crossing the Chasm，positioning formula is absolutely the same every time**
- **公式**：
  - "We are the **technology leaders** who have **specialized and committed** to solve **this problem**（use case in particular segment）"
  - "We have **huge respect for your incumbent vendor**（understand business but don't have new technology）"
  - "We're not asking you to kick them out. They just can't solve this problem"
  - "We have respect for our peers（technology competitors）, but they wouldn't recognize your problem in a lineup"
  - "We are here, and if anybody comes into our quadrant, we're going to **kick their ass**"
  - "We will be **beyond compare** in handling this problem with this kind of technology"

### **Seven Deadly Sins of Crossing the Chasm**

#### **1. Discounting Before Crossing the Chasm**
- **Heart surgery 9.99 this Saturday only**：Pragmatists don't want coupon for heart surgery
- **Discounting doesn't reduce risk**：In fact, might increase risk（vendor might reduce support, change scope）
- **Fair game on Main Street, not for crossing chasm**

#### **2. Target Customer Mix-Up**
- **关键问题**：Where is small pool of trapped value that we can **make our pool**？
- **四个维度**：Geography + Industry + Profession + Use Case
- **Who controls access? Who's going to sponsor my deal?**
- **Validation方法**：Run modest marketing campaign → see if can get 2-3 more deals with same pattern in 3 months

#### **3. Compelling Reason Confusion**
- **Compelling reason to SELL ≠ Compelling reason to BUY**
- **Entrepreneur's mistake**：Make sexier demo, change deck, write new collateral（all about selling）
- **Pragmatist needs**：Compelling reason to BUY（severe pain point）
- **"Shut the damn laptop"**：Start with "We're here because we've been working with people in your industry and understand there's serious problem around X. We believe your company might have it, is that true?"

#### **4. Marquee Customer ≠ Beachhead Customer**
- **Marquee customer**：Visionary sponsor in famous company（puts you on map, business press writes about）
- **Beachhead customer**：Pragmatist in target segment（first of 3-4-5-6 reputable companies to establish standard）
- **Visionary project can't be beachhead**：
  - They did weird things
  - They don't want to help industry（wanted to get ahead of competitors）
  - Can't use as reference for pragmatists

## 3. 心法与原则

- **"Big enough to matter, small enough to lead, good fit with crown jewels"**：Target segment的黄金公式
- **"Votes in Vermont don't count in New Hampshire"**：Focus resources on one segment at a time
- **"Pragmatists buy what they see their peers are buying"**：Peer reference is the key mechanism
- **"Ecosystems form around market leaders"**：You need to be #1 in some pond to attract ecosystem
- **"If it ain't broke, don't fix it"**：Pragmatist's mindset（vs. visionary's "break it"）
- **"It's never about you in bowling alley"**：Shut the damn laptop, talk about their pain
- **"Life never becomes easy"**：The problems change but there's always a new headache every week
- **"Don't waste your gift"**：If gifted enough to start software company and do something original, you're a scarce resource

## 4. 实战手册

### **Target Segment Selection Framework**
- **Big enough to matter**：
  - Room to double/triple double
  - 5-year window to reach $100M
  - But NOT $1B segment（wouldn't be big fish）
- **Small enough to lead**：
  - Top 20 customers in segment
  - Could achieve 30-50% market share
- **Good fit with crown jewels**：
  - Your technology uniquely solves their problem
- **Same geography + same industry + same profession**：
  - Dentists don't talk to software designers
  - Salespeople don't talk to finance people
  - Japan doesn't talk to US（different languages）
- **Compelling use case**：
  - Starts the fire
  - Forces customer to act faster than they want to
  - They're scared of you but more scared of their problem

### **Marquee Customer vs. Beachhead Customer**
- **Marquee（Early Market）**：
  - Visionary executive sponsor（"I'm tired of status quo, looking for visionary people like me, want to leapfrog the world"）
  - Famous company（Apple, Verizon, Mercedes）
  - Puts you on the map
  - Project model（snowflake, tons of special services）
  - **Cannot use as beachhead**：
    - They did weird things
    - Don't want to help competitors
    - Pragmatists won't accept visionary as reference
- **Beachhead（Bowling Alley）**：
  - Pragmatist in narrow segment
  - Has compelling pain point
  - 3-4-5-6 reputable companies to pick you
  - Establish market leadership（30-50% share）
  - **Radiating reference**：Someone who talks about you when you're not even in the room

### **Conversations That Work in Bowling Alley**
- **Opening**：
  - "We're here because we've been working with people in your industry and understand there's serious problem around [document management/WiFi access/etc]. We believe your company might have it, is that true?"
- **Two responses**：
  1. "Oh, are you kidding me? Okay, we have that"
  2. "Well, not exactly... but what our real problem is..."（they want therapy）
- **Diagnostic call**：
  - "Before we tell you about our solution, let's make sure we understand your challenges"
  - Goal：Get them to talk as much as possible, take notes
  - **Use pen（not laptop）**：They see you writing down their words = "He's listening"
  - On Zoom：Make sure camera shows your hands
- **Lead gen**：
  - "Do you have any of these seven symptoms of fatal churn?"
  - Responders are pre-qualified
  - BDR confirms："Just confirming you have these problems"
  - "Who's responsible?" → Call that person

### **Single Round Funding = Crossing Chasm Timeline**
- **18-24 months**：Single round should dominate single use case in single market
- **Not expensive**：
  - One geography + one industry + one profession
  - Marketing budget：Get message to ~200 people（no Super Bowl ads, no sock puppets）
  - Domain expertise enough to understand problem
- **Value pricing**：
  - Problem severe enough, customer doesn't want discount
  - Like heart surgery → don't want coupon, want Mayo Clinic
- **Guaranteed commitment**：
  - "We're going to take this problem off the table and not leaving until you're satisfied"
  - Overcommit to the problem

### **When to Cross the Chasm**
- **Prerequisite 1**：Major account gone all in with new technology + willing to talk about it（marquee customer）
- **Prerequisite 2**：Product has enough stability to be productized（pragmatists can't put up with buggy product）
- **Readiness signal**：
  - "I can't scale my business doing what I've been doing"
  - Want to change state from "cool possibility" to "going concern"（accountant's term）
- **Going concern**：
  - 2 years from now, expect to still exist
  - Loyal customer base
  - Ecosystem of partners
  - Established CAC and LTV
  - Figured out operating model
  - ~$10-20M revenue
- **Success marker**：
  - **Can survive without more venture funding**
  - Cashflow positive（not necessarily GAAP profitable）
  - Get to raise on your nickel and timeline, not "running out of money"

### **VC Funding Stages & Risk Reduction**
- **Angel investor**："Takes off table risk of whether you can even create anything"（enough money to get into trouble）
- **Crossing the Chasm round**："Takes company existence viability off the table"（don't know if grow, but won't go out of business）
- **Bowling alley round**："Journey from $10M to $100M"（expecting growth rate, rule of 40 kicks in）
- **Tornado round**："You're in Gen AI? Large language model? Worth a lot more"（category in tornado = different valuation）

### **When You're in Each Phase**
- **Early Market**：
  - Story is about disruptive technology
  - Need technology expert who's wizard
  - Can demo the technology
  - Create vision of trapped value release
- **Bowling Alley**：
  - Story is about the problem
  - Narrow down：geography + industry + profession + use case
  - Maintain intellectual curiosity about problem
  - Understand cost of NOT solving（risk exposure, growth gating item, churn）
- **Tornado**：
  - Budget established for category
  - Sales team calls customer who HAS budget
  - Land grab for market share
  - Ecosystem starts forming around leader
- **Main Street**：
  - Products commoditized
  - Service innovation
  - Product-led growth for expansion（low risk）

### **Why Playbooks Don't Work Together**
- **Classic Sales 101**：Qualify customer on budget before sales call
  - **Critical in Tornado**（budget has your name on it）
  - **Dumb on Main Street**（obviously have budget）
  - **Big mistake in Early Market or Bowling Alley**（they don't have budget）
- **Model mismatches**：
  - **Project model to Bowling Alley**：Won't scale, not repeatable, ecosystem won't form
  - **Solution model to Early Market**：Over-investing, visionary wants to take you off roadmap
- **Market dynamics call for very clear response**
- **The struggle**：I've been successful with this playbook, market moved to next phase, but I'm good at old playbook, want to stay with it → **that's when they get in trouble**

---

## 5. 反常识视角

- **"Discounting increases risk"**：In chasm（risk-bearing decisions），discounting doesn't reduce risk, might increase it（vendor might reduce support/change scope）
- **"Marquee customer ≠ Beachhead"**：
  - Visionary marquee（famous company）gets you on map BUT can't be beachhead
  - Beachhead requires pragmatist customers in narrow segment
  - Pragmatists won't accept visionary as reference
- **"Shut the damn laptop"**：In bowling alley, they hate demos, don't care about you, want to talk about their pain
- **"Votes in Vermont don't count in New Hampshire"**：Like presidential primaries → focus on one state at a time
- **"Life never becomes easy"**：
  - Crossing chasm doesn't mean downhill
  - Problems change but new headache every week
  - Competition, funding, technological shifts（data center → cloud → Kubernetes → edge AI）
- **"Ecosystems form around market leaders"**：
  - Oracle leader in databases for 40 years
  - Ecosystem organized around leader
  - If little → need to be big fish in small pond first
- **"Pragmatists clean up visionaries' messes"**：
  - Wariness of visionaries
  - Visionaries leave messes in their wake
  - Pragmatists have to clean them up

## 6. 花絮与细节

### **B2B vs. B2C Applicability**
- **Crossing the Chasm optimized for**：
  - B2B markets
  - Federated decision making
  - High-risk buying decisions
- **20th century**：95% of tech was B2B
- **21st century shift**：
  - Consumer computing came out of nowhere
  - Google, iPhone, mobile apps
  - B2C can be core of innovation
  - B2C might be afterthought now
- **Advice**：If building consumer app, don't spend time studying Crossing the Chasm. If B2B, still most reliable playbook 30 years later

### **Product-Led Growth & Chasm Crossing**
- **PLG plays different game**：
  - Attract end user before economic buyer
  - Freemium strategy
  - Need telemetry to understand what people are doing
  - Find compelling reason to buy in their environment
- **Cannot cross chasm with PLG**：
  - Like "curing Covid by putting vaccines in public places"
  - People need to learn more
- **PLG works best in**：
  - Land and expand phases
  - Main Street（low risk extensions）
  - When next purchase has very low risk
  - Not really dealing with chasms

### **Why PLG Companies Build Sales Teams**
- **Need to get enterprise deals**
- **Mistake**：Hiring enterprise salesperson when trying to cross chasm
- **Enterprise salespeople not good chasm crossers**：
  - Used to horizontal coverage model
  - Need domain expert narrow model
  - Want sales engineer type
  - Very diagnostic
  - Committed to integrity of problem-solution framework

### **VC Money's True Purpose**
- **What VC buys with money**：
  - "Use money to change state of company such that next investor values 2-3x higher"
- **If don't change value state**：
  - Raise at old valuation（investor loses）
  - Or down round（investor loses more）
- **Crossing the Chasm purpose**：
  - Change state from "cool possibility" to "going concern"
  - Get off "running out of money" fundraising
- **Many companies died in 2022-2023**：
  - Always thought "there'll be another round"
  - Not thinking about changing valuation state
  - Now not here

### **Martin Casado Debate**
- **His points**：
  - VC community doesn't deal with granularity of Crossing the Chasm anymore
  - Too much money wants to be put to work
  - Software already so pervasive → your software being disruptive increasingly improbable
  - Standing on shoulders of people standing on shoulders... of giants
- **Agreement**：Life never becomes easy, problems change
- **Software challenges**：
  - We all have different minds, different contexts
  - To make product work for what I want and what you want
  - Competition, funding, technological shifts
  - Data center → cloud → Kubernetes → edge AI → goes on and on
- **Entrepreneur advice**：Shouldn't start company unless you **can't not start a company**

### **Personal Evolution**
- **Changed mind about**：
  - Model optimized for B2B markets
  - B2C was afterthought in 20th century
  - Now B2C can be core innovation
  - Digital transformation still ongoing 20 years in
  - Crossing the Chasm not designed for that problem
- **Left because**：
  - Had to do own thing
  - Couldn't not start

### **《The Infinite Staircase》- Living a Good Life**
- **Purpose twofold**：
  1. **Model**：How to get from Big Bang to Lenny and Geoffrey talking（11 steps/stairs from physics to theory）
     - Assembling last 25 years of reading
     - Complexity emerges in layers
     - Staircase = series of layers
  2. **Ethics**：How to validate ethical action without divine creator？
     - Secular creation story
     - Ethics come from below, not above
- **Message**：
  - **You really do need to do good**
  - Not because obeying divine creator
  - Because **we're mammals and mammals nurture their young**
  - **Gifted with unconditional love at birth**
  - 1-year-old cannot survive if somebody doesn't love the hell out of them
  - **Values built into us**
  - They don't have to come from above, can come from below
  - Integrate them into your life

### **Final Advice**
- **World not nailing it right now**：
  - Lot of stuff going on that could do better
  - **Software-enabled technology at core of any solution that scales to world problems**
- **More important to be entrepreneur now than maybe ever**
- **Don't make becoming billionaire goal**：
  - Hard to imagine what to do with billion dollars
  - $1000 million = doesn't make sense
- **Do make**：Great living, make yourself comfortable, **after that, have impact**
- **If gifted enough to start software company and do something original**：
  - **You're a scarce resource, don't waste it**

### **Contact**
- **LinkedIn** + Blog on LinkedIn
- Message on LinkedIn
- Topics interesting → probably interested in blog
